<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. (<TENAME>NASDAQ</TENAME>: <TENAME>AAPL</TENAME>; <TENAME>NYSE</TENAME>: <TENAME>AAPL</TENAME>; previously <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Computer, Inc.) is an American multinational corporation that designs and markets consumer <TENAME>electronics</TENAME>, computer software, and personal computers. The company's best-known <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> products include the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> line of computers, the <TENAME>iPod</TENAME>, the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> and the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME>. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> software includes the <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X operating system; the <TENAME>iTunes</TENAME> media <TENAME>browser</TENAME>; the <TENAME>iLife suite</TENAME> of <TENAME>multimedia</TENAME> and <TENAME>creativity</TENAME> software; the <TENAME>iWork</TENAME> <TENAME>suite</TENAME> of productivity software; Aperture, a professional <TENAME>photography</TENAME> package; Final Cut Studio, a <TENAME>suite</TENAME> of professional <TENAME>audio</TENAME> and film-industry software products; Logic Studio, a <TENAME>suite</TENAME> of music production tools; the <TENAME>Safari</TENAME> web <TENAME>browser</TENAME>; and <TENAME>iOS</TENAME>, a mobile operating system. As of October 2010, the company operates 317 retail stores[3] in ten countries,[4] and an <TENAME>online</TENAME> store where <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> and software products are sold.[5] As of August 2011, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> is one of the largest companies in the world by market <TENAME>capitalization</TENAME> and the most valuable technology company in the world, ahead of <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>.[6] On August 9, 2011, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> briefly surpassed <TENAME>ExxonMobil</TENAME> to become the world's most valuable company[7] and surpassed them again the following day.

Main article: History of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc.
1976–1980: The early years


The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> I, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s first product, was sold as an assembled <TENAME>circuit</TENAME> board and lacked basic features such as a <TENAME>keyboard</TENAME>, <TENAME>monitor</TENAME>, and case. The owner of this unit added a <TENAME>keyboard</TENAME> and a wooden case.
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was established on April 1, 1976 by <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> <TENAME>Wozniak</TENAME>, and <TENAME>Ronald</TENAME> <TENAME>Wayne</TENAME>,[1] to sell the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> I personal computer kit. They were hand-built by <TENAME>Wozniak</TENAME>[17][18] and first shown to the public at the <TENAME>Homebrew</TENAME> Computer Club.[19] The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> I was sold as a motherboard (with <TENAME>CPU</TENAME>, <TENAME>RAM</TENAME>, and basic textual-video <TENAME>chips</TENAME>)—less than what is today considered a complete personal computer.[20] The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,572 in 2011 dollars, adjusted for <TENAME>inflation</TENAME>.)[21][22][23][24][25][26]
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was incorporated January 3, 1977[8] without <TENAME>Wayne</TENAME>, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and <TENAME>Wozniak</TENAME> for $800. <TENAME>Multi-millionaire</TENAME> Mike <TENAME>Markkula</TENAME> provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>.[27][28]
The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> II was introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first West Coast Computer <TENAME>Faire</TENAME>. It differed from its major rivals, the <TENAME>TRS-80</TENAME> and <TENAME>Commodore</TENAME> <TENAME>PET</TENAME>, because it came with <TENAME>color</TENAME> <TENAME>graphics</TENAME> and an open architecture. While early models used ordinary <TENAME>cassette</TENAME> tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drive and interface, the Disk II.[29]
The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> II was chosen to be the <TENAME>desktop</TENAME> platform for the first "<TENAME>killer</TENAME> <TENAME>app</TENAME>" of the business world—the <TENAME>VisiCalc</TENAME> <TENAME>spreadsheet</TENAME> program.[30] <TENAME>VisiCalc</TENAME> created a business market for the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> II, and gave home users an additional reason to buy an <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> II—compatibility with the office.[30] According to <TENAME>Brian</TENAME> <TENAME>Bagnall</TENAME>, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> exaggerated its sales figures and was a distant third place to <TENAME>Commodore</TENAME> and <TENAME>Tandy</TENAME> until <TENAME>VisiCalc</TENAME> came along.[31][32]
By the end of the <TENAME>1970s</TENAME>, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> had a staff of computer <TENAME>designers</TENAME> and a production line. The company introduced the ill-fated <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> III in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> and <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in the business and corporate <TENAME>computing</TENAME> market.[33]
Jobs and several <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> employees including <TENAME>Jef</TENAME> <TENAME>Raskin</TENAME> visited <TENAME>Xerox</TENAME> <TENAME>PARC</TENAME> in December 1979 to see the <TENAME>Xerox</TENAME> Alto. <TENAME>Xerox</TENAME> granted <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> engineers three days of access to the <TENAME>PARC</TENAME> facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[34] Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (<TENAME>GUI</TENAME>), and development of a <TENAME>GUI</TENAME> began for the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Lisa.[35]
When <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> went public, it generated more capital than any IPO since <TENAME>Ford</TENAME> Motor Company in 1956 and instantly created more <TENAME>millionaires</TENAME> (about 300) than any company in history.
1981–1985: <TENAME>Lisa</TENAME> and 


<TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> The Model from <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s "1984" ad, set in a dystopian future modeled after the <TENAME>George</TENAME> <TENAME>Orwell</TENAME> novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, set the tone for the introduction of the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>.
<TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs began working on the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Lisa in 1978 but in 1982 he was pushed from the <TENAME>Lisa</TENAME> team due to infighting, and took over <TENAME>Jef</TENAME> <TENAME>Raskin</TENAME>'s low-cost-computer project, the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>. A turf war broke out between <TENAME>Lisa</TENAME>'s "corporate shirts" and Jobs' "<TENAME>pirates</TENAME>" over which product would ship first and save <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>. <TENAME>Lisa</TENAME> won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a <TENAME>GUI</TENAME>, but was a commercial failure due to its high price <TENAME>tag</TENAME> and limited software titles.[36]


The first <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>, released in 1984
In 1984, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> next launched the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>. Its <TENAME>debut</TENAME> was announced by the now famous $1.5 million television commercial "1984". It was directed by <TENAME>Ridley</TENAME> <TENAME>Scott</TENAME>, aired during the third quarter of Super <TENAME>Bowl</TENAME> XVIII on January 22, 1984,[37] and is now considered a <TENAME>watershed</TENAME> event for <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s success[38] and a "<TENAME>masterpiece</TENAME>".[39][40]
The <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong[41] due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the <TENAME>LaserWriter</TENAME>, the first <TENAME>PostScript</TENAME> <TENAME>laser</TENAME> printer to be offered at a reasonable price, and <TENAME>PageMaker</TENAME>, an early <TENAME>desktop</TENAME> publishing package. The <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced <TENAME>graphics</TENAME> capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> GUI. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the <TENAME>desktop</TENAME> publishing market.[42]
In 1985 a power struggle developed between Jobs and <TENAME>CEO</TENAME> <TENAME>John</TENAME> <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME>, who had been hired two years earlier.[43] The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> board of directors instructed <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME> to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive <TENAME>forays</TENAME> into untested products. Rather than submit to <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME>'s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>. <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME> found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a <TENAME>putsch</TENAME> and called a board meeting at which <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s board of directors sided with <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME> and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.[41] Jobs resigned from <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> and founded NeXT Inc. the same year.[44]
1986–1993: Rise and fall

<TENAME>Macintosh models</TENAME> The <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> Portable was <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s first "<TENAME>portable</TENAME>" <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> computer, released in 1989.
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> Portable in 1989, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced the <TENAME>PowerBook</TENAME> in 1991, which established the modern form factor and ergonomic layout of the <TENAME>laptop</TENAME> computer.[45] The <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> Portable was designed to be just as powerful as a <TENAME>desktop</TENAME> Macintosh, but weighed 17 pounds with a 12-hour battery life. The same year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced System 7, a major <TENAME>upgrade</TENAME> to the operating system, which added <TENAME>color</TENAME> to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> until 2001.
The success of the <TENAME>PowerBook</TENAME> and other products brought increasing revenue.[43] For some time, it appeared that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The <TENAME>magazine</TENAME> <TENAME>MacAddict</TENAME> named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>.
Following the success of the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> LC, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced the <TENAME>Centris</TENAME> line, a low-end <TENAME>Quadra</TENAME> <TENAME>offering</TENAME>, and the ill-fated <TENAME>Performa</TENAME> line that was sold in several confusing <TENAME>configurations</TENAME> and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as <TENAME>Sears</TENAME>, Price Club, and <TENAME>Wal-Mart</TENAME>, the primary dealers for these models. The result was disastrous for <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> as consumers did not understand the difference between models.[46]
During this time <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including digital cameras, <TENAME>portable</TENAME> CD <TENAME>audio</TENAME> players, speakers, <TENAME>video</TENAME> consoles, and <TENAME>TV</TENAME> appliances. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued <TENAME>Newton</TENAME> division based on <TENAME>John</TENAME> <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME>'s unrealistic market forecasts.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] Ultimately, all of this proved too-little-too-late for <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> as their market share and stock prices continued to slide.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> saw the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> II series as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>.[47] In 1990, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> released the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> LC with a single expansion slot for the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> IIe Card to migrate <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> II users to the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> platform.[47] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> stopped selling the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> IIe in 1993.
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> continued to gain market share with Windows, focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.[48] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response. Instead they sued <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> for using a graphical user interface similar to the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Lisa in <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Computer, Inc. v. <TENAME>Microsoft Corporation</TENAME>.[49] The <TENAME>lawsuit</TENAME> dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed. At the same time, a series of major product <TENAME>flops</TENAME> and missed deadlines sullied <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s reputation, and <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME> was replaced by <TENAME>Michael</TENAME> <TENAME>Spindler</TENAME>.[50]
1994–1997: Attempts at reinvention


The <TENAME>Newton</TENAME> was <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s first <TENAME>foray</TENAME> into the PDA markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial <TENAME>flop</TENAME> at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the Palm Pilot and <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s own <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> and <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> in the future.
By the early <TENAME>1990s</TENAME>, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was developing alternative platforms to the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>, such as the A/<TENAME>UX</TENAME>. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> had also begun to experiment in providing a <TENAME>Mac-only</TENAME> <TENAME>online</TENAME> <TENAME>portal</TENAME> which they called <TENAME>eWorld</TENAME>, developed in collaboration with America <TENAME>Online</TENAME> and designed as a <TENAME>Mac-friendly</TENAME> alternative to other <TENAME>online</TENAME> services such as <TENAME>CompuServe</TENAME>. The <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the <TENAME>hardware</TENAME>. In addition, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was facing competition from <TENAME>OS</TENAME>/2 and <TENAME>UNIX</TENAME> vendors like Sun <TENAME>Microsystems</TENAME>. The <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful <TENAME>hardware</TENAME>.[51]
In 1994, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> allied with <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> and <TENAME>Motorola</TENAME> in the AIM alliance. The goal was to create a new <TENAME>computing</TENAME> platform (the <TENAME>PowerPC</TENAME> Reference Platform), which would use <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> and <TENAME>Motorola</TENAME> <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> coupled with <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s software. The AIM alliance hoped that <TENAME>PReP</TENAME>'s performance and <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s software would leave the <TENAME>PC</TENAME> far behind, thus countering <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>. The same year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced the Power <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>, the first of many <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> computers to use <TENAME>IBM</TENAME>'s <TENAME>PowerPC</TENAME> processor.[52]
In 1996, <TENAME>Michael</TENAME> <TENAME>Spindler</TENAME> was replaced by <TENAME>Gil</TENAME> <TENAME>Amelio</TENAME> as <TENAME>CEO</TENAME>. <TENAME>Gil</TENAME> <TENAME>Amelio</TENAME> made many changes at <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>, including massive <TENAME>layoffs</TENAME>.[53] After multiple failed attempts to improve <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME>, first with the <TENAME>Taligent</TENAME> project, then later with <TENAME>Copland</TENAME> and <TENAME>Gershwin</TENAME>, <TENAME>Amelio</TENAME> chose to purchase NeXT and its <TENAME>NeXTSTEP</TENAME> operating system, bringing <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs back to <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> as an advisor.[54] On July 9, 1997, <TENAME>Gil</TENAME> <TENAME>Amelio</TENAME> was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. Jobs became the interim <TENAME>CEO</TENAME> and began restructuring the company's product line.
At the 1997 <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> <TENAME>Expo</TENAME>, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs announced that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> would join <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> to release new versions of <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Office for the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>, and that <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> made a $150 million investment in non-voting <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> stock.[55]
On November 10, 1997, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Store, tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.[56][57]
1998–2005: Return to profitability
On August 15, 1998, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> 128K: the <TENAME>iMac</TENAME>. The <TENAME>iMac</TENAME> design team was led by <TENAME>Jonathan</TENAME> <TENAME>Ive</TENAME>, who would later design the <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> and the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>.[58][59] The <TENAME>iMac</TENAME> featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.[60]
Through this period, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> purchased several companies to create a <TENAME>portfolio</TENAME> of professional and consumer-oriented digital production software. In 1998, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> announced the purchase of <TENAME>Macromedia</TENAME>'s Final Cut software, signaling its expansion into the digital <TENAME>video</TENAME> editing market.[61] The following year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> released two <TENAME>video</TENAME> editing products: <TENAME>iMovie</TENAME> for consumers and, for professionals, Final Cut <TENAME>Pro</TENAME>, which has gone on to be a significant video-editing program, with 800,000 registered users in early 2007.[62] In 2002 <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[63] as well as <TENAME>Emagic</TENAME> for their music productivity application Logic, which led to the development of their consumer-level <TENAME>GarageBand</TENAME> application.[64][65] <TENAME>iPhoto</TENAME>'s release the same year completed the <TENAME>iLife suite</TENAME>.[66]


<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> retail stores allow potential customers to use floor models without making a purchase.
<TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X, based on NeXT's <TENAME>OPENSTEP</TENAME> and <TENAME>BSD</TENAME> <TENAME>Unix</TENAME> was released on March 24, 2001, after several years of development. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of <TENAME>Unix</TENAME> with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface. To aid users in migrating from <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> 9, the new operating system allowed the use of <TENAME>OS</TENAME> 9 applications through <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X's Classic environment.[67]
On May 19, 2001, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> opened the first official <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Retail Stores in Virginia and <TENAME>California</TENAME>.[68] later on July 9 they bought Spruce Technologies, a <TENAME>DVD</TENAME> authoring company. On October 23 of the same year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> announced the <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> <TENAME>portable</TENAME> digital <TENAME>audio</TENAME> player, and started selling it on November 10. The product was phenomenally successful — over 100 million units were sold within six years.[69][70] In 2003, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s <TENAME>iTunes Store</TENAME> was introduced, <TENAME>offering</TENAME> <TENAME>online</TENAME> music downloads for $0.99 a song and integration with the <TENAME>iPod</TENAME>. The service quickly became the market leader in <TENAME>online</TENAME> music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[71]
Since 2001 <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the <TENAME>iMac</TENAME> <TENAME>G3</TENAME>. This began with the <TENAME>titanium</TENAME> <TENAME>PowerBook</TENAME> and was followed by the white polycarbonate <TENAME>iBook</TENAME> and the flat-panel <TENAME>iMac</TENAME>.[72][73]

<TENAME>Intel transition</TENAME> The <TENAME>MacBook Pro </TENAME>(15.4" widescreen) was <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s first <TENAME>laptop</TENAME> with an <TENAME>Intel</TENAME> microprocessor. It was announced in January 2006 and is aimed at the professional market.
At the Worldwide <TENAME>Developers Conference</TENAME> keynote address on June 6, 2005, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs announced that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> would begin producing <TENAME>Intel-based</TENAME> <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> computers in 2006.[74] On January 10, 2006, the new <TENAME>MacBook Pro</TENAME> and <TENAME>iMac</TENAME> became the first <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> computers to use <TENAME>Intel</TENAME>'s Core <TENAME>Duo</TENAME> <TENAME>CPU</TENAME>. By August 7, 2006 <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> had transitioned the entire <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> product line to <TENAME>Intel</TENAME> chips, over one year sooner than announced.[74] The Power <TENAME>Mac</TENAME>, <TENAME>iBook</TENAME>, and <TENAME>PowerBook</TENAME> <TENAME>brands</TENAME> were retired during the transition; the <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>Pro</TENAME>, <TENAME>MacBook</TENAME>, and <TENAME>MacBook Pro</TENAME> became their respective successors.[75][76] On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street <TENAME>Journal</TENAME> reported that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was building its own team of engineers to design <TENAME>microchips</TENAME>.[77]
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> also introduced Boot Camp to help users install Windows <TENAME>XP</TENAME> or Windows Vista on their <TENAME>Intel</TENAME> Macs alongside <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X.[78]
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. In January 2006, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s market cap surpassed that of <TENAME>Dell</TENAME>.[79] Nine years prior, <TENAME>Dell</TENAME>'s <TENAME>CEO</TENAME> <TENAME>Michael</TENAME> <TENAME>Dell</TENAME> said that if he ran <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> he would "shut it down and give the money back to the <TENAME>shareholders</TENAME>."[80]
Although <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s market share in computers has grown, it remains far behind competitors using <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Windows, with only about 8% of <TENAME>desktops</TENAME> and <TENAME>laptops</TENAME> in the U.S.[81]
2007–present: <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> and <TENAME>iPad</TENAME>
Delivering his <TENAME>keynote</TENAME> speech at the <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> <TENAME>Expo</TENAME> on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Computer, Inc. would from that point on be known as <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc., because computers were no longer the main focus of the company, which had shifted its emphasis to mobile electronic devices. The event also saw the announcement of the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> and the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV.[82] The following day, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> shares <TENAME>hit</TENAME> $97.80, an all-time high at that point. In May, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s share price passed the $100 mark.[83]
In an article posted on <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s website on February 6, 2007, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs wrote that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> would be willing to sell music on the <TENAME>iTunes Store</TENAME> without <TENAME>DRM</TENAME> (which would allow tracks to be played on third-party players) if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[84] On April 2, 2007, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> and <TENAME>EMI</TENAME> jointly announced the removal of <TENAME>DRM</TENAME> technology from <TENAME>EMI</TENAME>'s <TENAME>catalog</TENAME> in the <TENAME>iTunes Store</TENAME>, effective in May.[85] Other record labels followed later that year.
In July of the following year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> launched the <TENAME>App Store</TENAME> to sell third-party applications for the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> and <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> Touch.[86] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and brought in $1 million daily on average, with Jobs speculating that the <TENAME>App Store</TENAME> could become a billion-dollar business for <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>.[87] Three months later, it was announced that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> had become the third-largest mobile <TENAME>handset</TENAME> supplier in the world due to the popularity of the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>.[88]
On December 16, 2008, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> announced that after over 20 years of attending <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME>, 2009 would be the last year <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> would be attending the <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> <TENAME>Expo</TENAME>, and that <TENAME>Phil</TENAME> <TENAME>Schiller</TENAME> would deliver the 2009 <TENAME>keynote</TENAME> in lieu of the expected Jobs.[89] Almost exactly one month later, on January 14, 2009, an internal <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> memo from Jobs announced that he would be taking a six-month leave of absence, until the end of June 2009, to allow him to better focus on his health and to allow the company to better focus on its products without having the rampant media speculating about his health.[90] Despite Jobs' absence, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> recorded its best non-holiday quarter (<TENAME>Q1</TENAME> FY 2009) during the <TENAME>recession</TENAME> with a revenue of $8.16 billion and a profit of $1.21 billion.[91]

After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks" <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> on January 27, 2010. The <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> runs the same touch based operating system that the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> uses and many of the same <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>apps</TENAME> are compatible with the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME>. This gave the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> a large <TENAME>app</TENAME> catalog on launch even with very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> was launched in the <TENAME>US</TENAME> and sold more than 300,000 units on that day and reaching 500,000 by the end of the first week.[92] In May of the same year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s market cap exceeded that of competitor <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> for the first time since 1989.[93]
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> released the fourth generation <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>, which introduced <TENAME>video</TENAME> calling, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design, which acts as the phone's <TENAME>antenna</TENAME>. Because of this <TENAME>antenna</TENAME> implementation, some <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> 4 users reported a reduction in signal strength when the phone is held in specific ways. After a large amount of media coverage including <TENAME>mainstream</TENAME> news organizations, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> held a press conference where they offered buyers a free rubber 'bumper' case, which had been proven to eliminate the signal reduction issue. Later that year <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> again refreshed its <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> line of <TENAME>MP3</TENAME> players which introduced a multi-touch <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> <TENAME>Nano</TENAME>, <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> Touch with <TENAME>FaceTime</TENAME>, and <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> <TENAME>Shuffle</TENAME> with buttons which brought back the buttons of earlier generations.[94][95][96]
In October 2010, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> shares <TENAME>hit</TENAME> an all-time high, eclipsing $300.[97] Additionally, on October 20, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> updated their <TENAME>MacBook Air</TENAME> laptop, <TENAME>iLife suite</TENAME> of applications, and unveiled <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X Lion, the latest <TENAME>installment</TENAME> in their <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X operating system.[98] On January 6, 2011, the company opened their <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>App Store</TENAME>, a digital software distribution platform, similar to the existing <TENAME>iOS</TENAME> <TENAME>App Store</TENAME>.[99] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was featured in the documentary Something Ventured which premiered in 2011.
On January 17, 2011, an internal <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> memo from Jobs announced that he will once again take a medical leave of absence, for an indefinite period, to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer <TENAME>Timothy</TENAME> D. <TENAME>Cook</TENAME> will take up Jobs' day-to-day operations at <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>, although Jobs will still remain "involved in major strategic decisions for the company."[100]
After <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. surpassed <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in market <TENAME>capitalization</TENAME> in 2010, it also become the most valuable consumer-facing <TENAME>brand</TENAME> in the world with an 84 percent increase to $19.1 billion.[101]
In June of 2011, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> unveiled its new <TENAME>online</TENAME> storage and syncing service for music, <TENAME>photos</TENAME>, files and software -- <TENAME>iCloud</TENAME>. [102]
It has been argued that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has achieved such efficiency in their supply chain[103] that they have something like a <TENAME>monopsony</TENAME> (one buyer, many sellers) in that it can dictate terms to its suppliers[104].
As of July 2011, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has bigger financial reserves than the <TENAME>US</TENAME> government, 76.4 billion <TENAME>US</TENAME> dollars, compared with the government's 73.7 billion.[105][dated <TENAME>info</TENAME>]

On March 2, 2011, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> introduced an updated <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> model which had a faster processor and two cameras on the front and back respectively. The <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> 2 also added support for optional <TENAME>3G</TENAME> service provided by <TENAME>Verizon</TENAME> in addition to the existing <TENAME>offering</TENAME> by AT&T.[109] However, the availability of the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> 2 has been limited as a result of the devastating <TENAME>tsunami</TENAME> and ensuing earthquake in Japan in March 2011.[110]

Main article: <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>
At the <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> Conference & <TENAME>Expo</TENAME> in January 2007, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs revealed the long anticipated[112] <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>, a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and <TENAME>iPod</TENAME>.[113] The original <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> combined a 2.<TENAME>5G</TENAME> <TENAME>quad</TENAME> band <TENAME>GSM</TENAME> and EDGE cellular phone with features found in hand held devices, running scaled-down versions of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X (dubbed <TENAME>iOS</TENAME>, formerly <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME>), with various <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> X applications such as <TENAME>Safari</TENAME> and <TENAME>Mail</TENAME>. It also includes web-based and <TENAME>Dashboard</TENAME> <TENAME>apps</TENAME> such as <TENAME>Google</TENAME> Maps and Weather. The <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touch screen display, 4, 8, or 16 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> of memory, <TENAME>Bluetooth</TENAME>, and <TENAME>Wi-Fi</TENAME> (both "b" and "g").[113] The <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> first became available on June 29, 2007 for $499 (4 <TENAME>GB</TENAME>) and $599 (8 <TENAME>GB</TENAME>) with an AT&T contract.[114] On February 5, 2008, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> updated the original <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> to have 16 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> of memory, in addition to the 8 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> and 4 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> models.[115] On June 9, 2008, at <TENAME>WWDC</TENAME> 2008, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs announced that the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>3G</TENAME> would be available on July 11, 2008.[116] This version added support for <TENAME>3G</TENAME> networking, assisted-GPS navigation, and a price cut to $199 for the 8 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> version, and $299 for the 16 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> version, which was available in both black and white. The new version was visually different from its <TENAME>predecessor</TENAME> in that it eliminated the flat silver back, and large <TENAME>antenna</TENAME> square for a curved glossy black or white back. Following complaints from many people, the <TENAME>headphone</TENAME> <TENAME>jack</TENAME> was changed from a recessed <TENAME>jack</TENAME> to a flush <TENAME>jack</TENAME> to be compatible with more styles of <TENAME>headphones</TENAME>. The software capabilities changed as well, with the release of the new <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> came the release of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s <TENAME>App Store</TENAME>; the store provided applications for download that were compatible with the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>. On April 24, 2009, the <TENAME>App Store</TENAME> surpassed one billion downloads.[117] On June 8, 2009, at <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s annual worldwide <TENAME>developers conference</TENAME>, the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>3GS</TENAME> was announced, providing an incremental update to the device including faster internal components, support for faster <TENAME>3G</TENAME> speeds, <TENAME>video</TENAME> recording capability, and voice control. On June 7, 2010, at <TENAME>WWDC</TENAME> 2010, the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> 4 was announced, which <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> says is its "'biggest leap we've taken" since the original <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>.[118] The phone includes an all-new design, 960x640 display, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s <TENAME>A4</TENAME> processor used in the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME>, a gyroscope for enhanced <TENAME>gaming</TENAME>, <TENAME>5MP</TENAME> camera with LED flash, front-facing <TENAME>VGA</TENAME> camera and <TENAME>FaceTime</TENAME> <TENAME>video</TENAME> calling. Shortly after the release of the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> 4, it was realized by consumers that the new <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> had reception issues. This is due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phones cellular signal and <TENAME>Wi-Fi</TENAME> <TENAME>antenna</TENAME>. The current <TENAME>fix</TENAME> for this issue was a "Bumper Case" for the phone distributed for free to all <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> 4 owners for a few months. In June 2011, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> overtook <TENAME>Nokia</TENAME> to become the world's biggest smartphone <TENAME>maker</TENAME> by volume.[119]

The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV, in its most recent revision
At the 2007 <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> conference, Jobs demonstrated the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV, (previously known as the <TENAME>iTV</TENAME>),[120] a set-top <TENAME>video</TENAME> device intended to bridge the sale of content from <TENAME>iTunes</TENAME> with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's <TENAME>TV</TENAME> and <TENAME>syncs</TENAME>, either via <TENAME>Wi-Fi</TENAME> or a wired network, with one computer's <TENAME>iTunes</TENAME> library and streams from an additional four. The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV originally incorporated a 40 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> hard drive for storage, includes outputs for <TENAME>HDMI</TENAME> and component <TENAME>video</TENAME>, and plays <TENAME>video</TENAME> at a maximum resolution of 720p.[121] On May 31, 2007 a 160 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> drive was released alongside the existing 40 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> model[122] and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV.[123] In September 2009, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> discontinued the original 40 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV. On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> devices for the year, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> released a completely redesigned <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any <TENAME>iTunes</TENAME> library on the network along with 8 <TENAME>GB</TENAME> of flash memory to cache media downloaded. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> with the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> TV has added another device to its <TENAME>portfolio</TENAME> that runs on its <TENAME>A4</TENAME> processor along with the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME> and the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>. The memory included in the device is the half of the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> 4 at 256 MB; the same as the <TENAME>iPad</TENAME>, <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>3GS</TENAME>, <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> touch <TENAME>3G</TENAME>, and <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> touch <TENAME>4G</TENAME>.[124] It has <TENAME>HDMI</TENAME> out as the only <TENAME>video</TENAME> out source. Features include access to the <TENAME>iTunes Store</TENAME> to rent <TENAME>movies</TENAME> and <TENAME>TV</TENAME> shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from <TENAME>internet</TENAME> <TENAME>video</TENAME> sources, including <TENAME>YouTube</TENAME> and <TENAME>Netflix</TENAME>, and media streaming from an <TENAME>iTunes</TENAME> library. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> also reduced the price of the device to $99.

Culture

Corporate
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was one of several highly successful companies founded in the <TENAME>1970s</TENAME> that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal <TENAME>attire</TENAME>, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include Southwest <TENAME>Airlines</TENAME> and <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> by default, thanks to the influence of its <TENAME>founders</TENAME>; <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the "1984" <TENAME>TV</TENAME> ad, this trait had become a key way the company attempts to differentiate itself from its competitors.[126]
As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief <TENAME>executives</TENAME>, each with his own idea of what <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> still has a reputation for fostering <TENAME>individuality</TENAME> and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its <TENAME>employ</TENAME>, especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> created the <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal <TENAME>computing</TENAME> while at the company. The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including <TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Atkinson</TENAME>,[127] <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> <TENAME>Capps</TENAME>,[128] Rod <TENAME>Holt</TENAME>,[127] <TENAME>Alan</TENAME> <TENAME>Kay</TENAME>,[129][130] <TENAME>Guy</TENAME> <TENAME>Kawasaki</TENAME>,[129][131] Al <TENAME>Alcorn</TENAME>,[132] Don Norman,[129] Rich Page,[127] and <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> <TENAME>Wozniak</TENAME>.[127]
Numerous employees of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often take longer than projects with his involvement.[133] Another presents the image of Jobs "wandering the hall with a flame <TENAME>thrower</TENAME> in hand, asking random people 'do you work on <TENAME>MobileMe</TENAME>?'".[134]
Users


<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> aficionados wait in line around an <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> retail store in anticipation of a new product. This branch is located on Fifth Avenue in New York City, with a glass cube housing a cylindrical <TENAME>elevator</TENAME> and a spiral staircase that lead into the subterranean store.
While this <TENAME>brand</TENAME> loyalty is considered unusual for any product, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> evangelists were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> evangelist <TENAME>Guy</TENAME> <TENAME>Kawasaki</TENAME> has called the <TENAME>brand</TENAME> fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon".[135] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> User Groups in most major and many minor <TENAME>centers</TENAME> of population where <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> computers are available.
<TENAME>Mac</TENAME> users would meet at the European <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Expo and the San Francisco <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> Conference & <TENAME>Expo</TENAME> trade shows where <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> does not have official representation there. <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>developers</TENAME>, in turn, continue to gather at the annual <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Worldwide <TENAME>Developers Conference</TENAME>.
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Store openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.[136] The New York City Fifth Avenue "Cube" store had a line as long as half a <TENAME>mile</TENAME>; a few <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>fans</TENAME> took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.[137] The <TENAME>Ginza</TENAME> opening in <TENAME>Tokyo</TENAME> was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.[138]
<TENAME>John</TENAME> <TENAME>Sculley</TENAME> told The Guardian newspaper in 1997: "People talk about technology, but <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade."[139]
Research in 2002 by <TENAME>NetRatings</TENAME> indicate that the average <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> consumer was usually more affluent and more well-educated than other <TENAME>PC</TENAME> company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. products are more expensive than other <TENAME>PC</TENAME> products.[140][141]

During the <TENAME>Mac</TENAME>'s early history <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for <TENAME>hardware</TENAME>, instead creating their own.[142] This trend was largely reversed in the late <TENAME>1990s</TENAME> beginning with <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s adoption of the <TENAME>PCI</TENAME> bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power <TENAME>Macs</TENAME>. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has since adopted <TENAME>USB</TENAME>, <TENAME>AGP</TENAME>, <TENAME>HyperTransport</TENAME>, <TENAME>Wi-Fi</TENAME>, and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as <TENAME>USB</TENAME>.[143] <TENAME>FireWire</TENAME> is an <TENAME>Apple-originated</TENAME> standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as <TENAME>IEEE</TENAME> 1394.[144]
Ever since the first <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Store opened, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has sold third party accessories.[145] This allows, for instance, <TENAME>Nikon</TENAME> and <TENAME>Canon</TENAME> to sell their <TENAME>Mac-compatible</TENAME> digital cameras and <TENAME>camcorders</TENAME> inside the store. <TENAME>Adobe</TENAME>, one of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s oldest software partners,[146] also sells its <TENAME>Mac-compatible</TENAME> software, as does <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>, who sells <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Office for the <TENAME>Mac</TENAME>. Books from <TENAME>John</TENAME> Wiley & Sons, who publishes the For Dummies series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however. The <TENAME>publisher</TENAME>'s line of books were banned from <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Stores in 2005 because <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs <TENAME>biography</TENAME>, <TENAME>iCon</TENAME>.[147]

Company headquarters on Infinite Loop in <TENAME>Cupertino</TENAME>, <TENAME>California</TENAME>
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of <TENAME>Silicon</TENAME> Valley, at 1 Infinite Loop, <TENAME>Cupertino</TENAME>, <TENAME>California</TENAME>. This <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> campus has six buildings that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) and was built in 1993 by <TENAME>Sobrato</TENAME> Development <TENAME>Cos</TENAME>.[148]
In 2006, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> announced its intention to build a second <TENAME>campus</TENAME> on 50 <TENAME>acres</TENAME> (200,000 m2) assembled from various contiguous plots (east of N <TENAME>Wolfe</TENAME> Road between <TENAME>Pruneridge</TENAME> Avenue and <TENAME>Vallco</TENAME> <TENAME>Parkway</TENAME>). The new <TENAME>campus</TENAME>, also in <TENAME>Cupertino</TENAME>, will be about 1 <TENAME>mile</TENAME> (1.6 km) east of the current <TENAME>campus</TENAME>.[149] The new <TENAME>campus</TENAME> building will be designed by Norman Foster[150]

Further information: Think Different, Get a <TENAME>Mac</TENAME>, and <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Switch ad campaign
Since the introduction of the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> in 1984 with the 1984 Super <TENAME>Bowl</TENAME> commercial to the more modern 'Get a <TENAME>Mac</TENAME>' adverts, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective <TENAME>advertising</TENAME> and marketing for its products, though its <TENAME>advertising</TENAME> has been criticized for the claims of some more recent campaigns, particularly 2005 Power <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> ads[151][152][153] and <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> ads in Britain.
<TENAME>Logos</TENAME>

The original <TENAME>logo</TENAME> with <TENAME>Isaac</TENAME> <TENAME>Newton</TENAME> under an 

<TENAME>apple tree</TENAME> The rainbow "bitten" <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, used from late 1976 to 1998

The monochrome <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, used since 1998
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s first <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, <TENAME>Wayne</TENAME>, depicts Sir <TENAME>Isaac</TENAME> <TENAME>Newton</TENAME> sitting under an <TENAME>apple tree</TENAME>.
Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by Rob <TENAME>Janoff</TENAME>'s "rainbow <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>", the now-familiar rainbow-colored <TENAME>silhouette</TENAME> of an <TENAME>apple</TENAME> with a <TENAME>bite</TENAME> taken out of it. <TENAME>Janoff</TENAME> presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, and Jobs immediately took a <TENAME>liking</TENAME> to it. While Jobs liked the <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, he insisted it be in <TENAME>color</TENAME> to humanize the company.[154][155] The <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> logo was designed with a <TENAME>bite</TENAME> so that it wouldn't be recognized as another fruit. The colored <TENAME>stripes</TENAME> were conceived to make the <TENAME>logo</TENAME> more accessible, and to represent the fact the <TENAME>monitor</TENAME> could reproduce images in <TENAME>color</TENAME>.[156] The <TENAME>logo</TENAME> is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to <TENAME>Alan</TENAME> <TENAME>Turing</TENAME>, with the <TENAME>bite</TENAME> mark a reference to his method of suicide.[157][158] Both the <TENAME>designer</TENAME> of the <TENAME>logo</TENAME> and the company deny that there is any <TENAME>homage</TENAME> to <TENAME>Turing</TENAME> in the design of the <TENAME>logo</TENAME>.[156][159]
In 1998, with the roll-out of the new <TENAME>iMac</TENAME>, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow <TENAME>incarnation</TENAME>, on various products, packaging and <TENAME>advertising</TENAME>. An <TENAME>Aqua-themed</TENAME> version of the monochrome <TENAME>logo</TENAME> was used from 2001–2003, and a <TENAME>Glass-themed</TENAME> version has been used since 2003.
In the past, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. has had trademark issues between themselves and <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Corps ltd., a <TENAME>multimedia</TENAME> company started by the <TENAME>Beatles</TENAME> in 1967, involving their name and <TENAME>logo</TENAME>. This resulted in a series of <TENAME>lawsuits</TENAME> and tension between the two companies. These issues finally ended with their most recent law suit in 2007.
Slogans
Main article: List of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. slogans
<TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s first slogan, "<TENAME>Byte</TENAME> into an <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>", was coined in the late <TENAME>1970s</TENAME>.[160] From 1997–2002, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> used the slogan Think Different in <TENAME>advertising</TENAME> campaigns. The slogan had a lasting impact on their image and revived their popularity with the media and customers, and the grammar caused a bit of discussion (i.e. "think" is a verb, which is modified by adverbs; therefore the adverb "differently" should be used, not the adjective "different"[161]). Although the slogan has been retired, it is still closely associated with <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>.[162] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> also has slogans for specific product lines — for example, "<TENAME>iThink</TENAME>, therefore <TENAME>iMac</TENAME>" was used in 1998 to promote the <TENAME>iMac</TENAME>,[163] and "Say <TENAME>hello</TENAME> to <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME>" has been used in <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> advertisements.[164] "<TENAME>Hello</TENAME>" was also used to introduce the original <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME>, <TENAME>Newton</TENAME>, <TENAME>iMac</TENAME> ("<TENAME>hello</TENAME> (again)"), and <TENAME>iPod</TENAME>.[165]

<TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s product <TENAME>commercials</TENAME> gained <TENAME>fame</TENAME> for launching musicians into <TENAME>stardom</TENAME> as a result of their eye-popping <TENAME>graphics</TENAME> and catchy tunes.[166] First, the company popularized Canadian <TENAME>singer</TENAME> <TENAME>Feist</TENAME>'s "1234" song in its ad campaign.[166] Later, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> used the song "New Soul" by <TENAME>French-Israeli</TENAME> singer-songwriter <TENAME>Yael</TENAME> <TENAME>Naïm</TENAME> to promote the <TENAME>MacBook Air</TENAME>.[166] The <TENAME>debut</TENAME> single shot to the top of the charts and sold hundreds of thousands of copies in a <TENAME>span</TENAME> of weeks.[166]
Environmental record

	<TENAME>Wikinews</TENAME> has related news: '<TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s data is dirtiest,' says <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME>
<TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME>, an environmental organization, has confronted <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> on various environmental issues, including promoting a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> components, and toxins within the <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>hardware</TENAME>.[167][168] Since 2003 they have campaigned against <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> regarding their chemical policies, in particular the inclusion of PVC and <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME> in their products, both of which have serious negative health effects.[167] At the 2007 <TENAME>Macworld</TENAME> <TENAME>Expo</TENAME>, <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME> presented a <TENAME>critique</TENAME> of <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>. Rick Hind, the legislative director of <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME>'s <TENAME>toxics</TENAME> campaign, said, "(The company) is getting greener, but not green enough." Hind commented further, "The <TENAME>MacBook Air</TENAME> has less toxic PVC plastic and less toxic <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME>, but it could have zero and that would make <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> an eco-leader."[169] On May 2, 2007, <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> Jobs released a report announcing plans to eliminate PVC and <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME> by the end of 2008.[170][171] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has since eliminated PVC and <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME> across its product range.[172] It became the first <TENAME>laptop</TENAME> <TENAME>maker</TENAME> to remove PVC and <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME>.[173]
In <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME>'s Guide to Greener <TENAME>Electronics</TENAME> that scores <TENAME>electronics</TENAME> manufacturers on their policies regarding toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> ranked 9th out of 18 leading electronic <TENAME>makers</TENAME> in October 2010 with a score of 4.9/10 (securing the same score as in the previous version of the guide, however slipping 4 places down the <TENAME>ranking</TENAME>).[174] <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME> criticizes for example that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> does not provide information about its management of chemicals and its supply chain communications. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> also continues to score poorly in the <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME>'s guide for the minimal information it provides about its future toxic chemical phase-out plans.[175] In the first edition, released in August 2006, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> scored 2.7/10.[176]
In 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> in their top category "Striding".[177] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> 11 points out of a 100, which placed the company last among <TENAME>electronics</TENAME> companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> with a "stuck <TENAME>icon</TENAME>", adding that <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".[16]
The Environmental Protection Agency rates <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> highest amongst producers of notebook computers, and fairly well compared to producers of <TENAME>desktop computers</TENAME> and LCD displays.[178][179]
In June 2007, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> upgraded the <TENAME>MacBook Pro</TENAME>, replacing cold cathode fluorescent lamp (<TENAME>CCFL</TENAME>) backlit LCD displays with mercury-free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass,[180] and has since done this for all notebooks. <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> has also phased out <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME> and <TENAME>PVCs</TENAME> from various internal components.[170][181][182] <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> also offers detailed information about the emissions, materials, and electrical usage of each product.[183]
In June 2009, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>'s <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> <TENAME>3GS</TENAME> was free of PVC, <TENAME>arsenic</TENAME>, <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME> and had an efficient power <TENAME>adapter</TENAME>.[180]
In October 2009, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> upgraded the <TENAME>iMac</TENAME> and <TENAME>MacBook</TENAME>, replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (<TENAME>CCFL</TENAME>) backlit LCD displays with mercury-free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass.[184] This means all <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> computers have mercury free LED backlit displays, arsenic-free glass and are without PVC <TENAME>cables</TENAME>. All <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> computers also have <TENAME>EPEAT</TENAME> Gold status.[180]
In popular culture

In 2009, British pop band The <TENAME>Mentalists</TENAME> (see <TENAME>Alice</TENAME> <TENAME>Offley</TENAME>) achieved international press recognition for being the first band to perform a song using only <TENAME>iPhones</TENAME> and <TENAME>iPods</TENAME>. [185][186]
<TENAME>Labor</TENAME> practices

Further information: <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> labor practices
In 2006, the <TENAME>Mail</TENAME> on Sunday reported that <TENAME>sweatshop</TENAME> conditions existed in some factories in China, where the contract manufacturers, <TENAME>Foxconn</TENAME> and <TENAME>Inventec</TENAME>, operate the factories that produce the <TENAME>iPod</TENAME>.[187] The article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the <TENAME>iPod</TENAME> (among other items), for instance, had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week. The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.[15][188][189][190]
Immediately after the <TENAME>allegations</TENAME>, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturers to ensure that conditions were acceptable to <TENAME>Apple</TENAME>.[191] In 2007, <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.[192] In 2010, workers in China planned to sue <TENAME>iPhone</TENAME> contractors over poisoning by a <TENAME>cleaner</TENAME> used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his <TENAME>coworkers</TENAME> had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[193]
