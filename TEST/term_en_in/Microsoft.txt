<TENAME>Microsoft Corporation </TENAME>(<TENAME>NASDAQ</TENAME>: <TENAME>MSFT</TENAME>) is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in <TENAME>Redmond</TENAME>, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, <TENAME>licenses</TENAME>, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to <TENAME>computing</TENAME> through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC <TENAME>interpreters</TENAME> for the <TENAME>Altair</TENAME> 8800, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with <TENAME>MS-DOS</TENAME> in the <TENAME>mid-1980s</TENAME>, followed by the <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Windows line of operating systems.
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> would also come to dominate the office <TENAME>suite</TENAME> market with <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the <TENAME>video game</TENAME> industry with the <TENAME>Xbox</TENAME> and its successor, the <TENAME>Xbox</TENAME> 360 as well as into the consumer <TENAME>electronics</TENAME> and digital services market with <TENAME>Zune</TENAME>, <TENAME>MSN</TENAME> and the Windows Phone <TENAME>OS</TENAME>. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public <TENAME>offering</TENAME> (IPO) made an estimated four <TENAME>billionaires</TENAME> and 12,000 <TENAME>millionaires</TENAME> from <TENAME>Microsoft employees</TENAME>. In May 2011, <TENAME>Microsoft Corporation</TENAME> acquired <TENAME>Skype</TENAME> Communications for $8.5 billion dollars.[1]
Primarily in the <TENAME>1990s</TENAME>, <TENAME>critics</TENAME> contend <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> used monopolistic business practices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying, put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software, and used misrepresentative marketing <TENAME>tactics</TENAME>; both the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission found the company in violation of antitrust laws. Known for its interviewing process with obscure questions, various studies and ratings were generally favorable to <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s diversity within the company as well as its overall environmental impact with the exception of the <TENAME>electronics</TENAME> portion of the business.

<TENAME>Paul</TENAME> <TENAME>Allen</TENAME> and <TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> (respectively) on October 19, 1981 in a sea of <TENAME>PCs</TENAME> after signing a pivotal contract. <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> called <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in July 1980 <TENAME>inquiring</TENAME> about programming languages for its upcoming <TENAME>PC</TENAME> line;[2] after failed negotiations with another company, <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> gave <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> a contract to develop the <TENAME>OS</TENAME> for the new line of <TENAME>PCs</TENAME>.[3]
<TENAME>Paul</TENAME> <TENAME>Allen</TENAME> and <TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME>, childhood friends with a passion in computer programming, were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. The January 1975 issue of Popular <TENAME>Electronics</TENAME> featured Micro <TENAME>Instrumentation</TENAME> and <TENAME>Telemetry</TENAME> Systems's (MITS) <TENAME>Altair</TENAME> 8800 <TENAME>microcomputer</TENAME>. <TENAME>Allen</TENAME> noticed that they could program a BASIC <TENAME>interpreter</TENAME> for the device; after a call from <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> claiming to have a working <TENAME>interpreter</TENAME>, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn't actually have one, <TENAME>Allen</TENAME> worked on a simulator for the <TENAME>Altair</TENAME> while <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> developed the <TENAME>interpreter</TENAME>. Although they developed the <TENAME>interpreter</TENAME> on a simulator and not the actual device, the <TENAME>interpreter</TENAME> worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the <TENAME>interpreter</TENAME> to MITS in <TENAME>Albuquerque</TENAME>, New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as <TENAME>Altair</TENAME> BASIC.[4] They officially established <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> on April 4, 1975, with <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> as the <TENAME>CEO</TENAME>.[5] <TENAME>Allen</TENAME> came up with the original name of "<TENAME>Micro-Soft</TENAME>," as recounted in a 1995 Fortune <TENAME>magazine</TENAME> article. In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII <TENAME>Magazine</TENAME> in Japan, resulting in its first international office, "ASCII <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>".[6] The company moved to a new home in <TENAME>Bellevue</TENAME>, Washington in January 1979.[5]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> entered the <TENAME>OS</TENAME> business in 1980 with its own version of <TENAME>Unix</TENAME>, called <TENAME>Xenix</TENAME>.[7] However, it was DOS (Disk Operating System) that solidified the company's <TENAME>dominance</TENAME>. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> awarded a contract to <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in November 1980 to provide a version of the <TENAME>CP</TENAME>/M <TENAME>OS</TENAME>, which was set to be used in the upcoming <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> Personal Computer (<TENAME>IBM PC</TENAME>).[8] For this deal, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> purchased a <TENAME>CP</TENAME>/M <TENAME>clone</TENAME> called <TENAME>86-DOS</TENAME> from <TENAME>Seattle</TENAME> Computer Products, branding it as <TENAME>MS-DOS</TENAME>, which <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> rebranded to <TENAME>PC-DOS</TENAME>. Following the release of the <TENAME>IBM PC</TENAME> in August 1981, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> retained ownership of <TENAME>MS-DOS</TENAME>. Since <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> copyrighted the <TENAME>IBM PC</TENAME> BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> to run as <TENAME>IBM PC</TENAME> compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Due to various factors, such as <TENAME>MS-DOS</TENAME>'s available software selection[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed], <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> eventually became the leading <TENAME>PC</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> vendor.[3][9] The company expanded into new markets with the release of the <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Mouse in 1983, as well as a <TENAME>publishing</TENAME> division named <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Press.[10] <TENAME>Paul</TENAME> <TENAME>Allen</TENAME> resigned from <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in February after developing <TENAME>Hodgkin</TENAME>'s disease.[11]
1984–1994: Windows and Office
While jointly developing a new <TENAME>OS</TENAME> with <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> in 1984, <TENAME>OS</TENAME>/2, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> released <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Windows, a graphical extension for <TENAME>MS-DOS</TENAME>, on November 20.[12] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> moved its headquarters to <TENAME>Redmond</TENAME> on February 26, 1986, and on March 13 the company went public;[13] the ensuing rise in the stock would make an estimated four <TENAME>billionaires</TENAME> and 12,000 <TENAME>millionaires</TENAME> from <TENAME>Microsoft employees</TENAME>.[14] Due to the partnership with <TENAME>IBM</TENAME>, in 1990 the Federal Trade Commission set its eye on <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> for possible <TENAME>collusion</TENAME>; it marked the beginning of over a decade of legal <TENAME>clashes</TENAME> with the U.S. Government.[15] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> announced the release of its version of <TENAME>OS</TENAME>/2 to original equipment manufacturers (<TENAME>OEMs</TENAME>) on April 2, 1987;[16] meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit <TENAME>OS</TENAME>, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Windows NT, using ideas from <TENAME>OS</TENAME>/2; it shipped on July 21, 1993 with a new modular kernel and the <TENAME>Win32</TENAME> application programming interface (<TENAME>API</TENAME>), making porting from 16-bit (<TENAME>MS-DOS-based</TENAME>) Windows easier. Once <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> informed <TENAME>IBM</TENAME> of NT, the <TENAME>OS</TENAME>/2 partnership deteriorated.[17]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> introduced its office <TENAME>suite</TENAME>, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Office, in 1990. The software bundled separate office productivity applications, such as <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Word and <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Excel.[18] On May 22 <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> launched Windows 3.0 with a streamlined user interface <TENAME>graphics</TENAME> and improved protected mode capability for the <TENAME>Intel</TENAME> 386 processor.[19] Both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[20][21] <TENAME>Novell</TENAME>, a Word competitor from 1984–1986, filed a <TENAME>lawsuit</TENAME> years later claiming that <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage.[22]
On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part: "Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> induced many <TENAME>OEMs</TENAME> to execute anticompetitive "per processor" <TENAME>licenses</TENAME>. Under a per processor <TENAME>license</TENAME>, an <TENAME>OEM</TENAME> pays <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> a <TENAME>royalty</TENAME> for each computer it sells containing a particular <TENAME>microprocessor</TENAME>, whether the <TENAME>OEM</TENAME> sells the computer with a <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the <TENAME>royalty</TENAME> payment to <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> when no <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the <TENAME>OEM</TENAME>'s use of a competing <TENAME>PC</TENAME> operating system. Since 1988, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s use of per processor <TENAME>licenses</TENAME> has increased."[23]

<TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> giving his deposition in 1998 for the United States v. <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> trial. Once the U.S. Department of Justice 1993 took over from the Federal Trade Commission, a protracted legal <TENAME>wrangling</TENAME> between <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> and the department ensued, resulting in various settlements and possible blocked mergers. <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> would point to companies such as <TENAME>AOL-Time</TENAME> <TENAME>Warner</TENAME> in its <TENAME>defense</TENAME>.[15]
Following <TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME>'s internal "<TENAME>Internet</TENAME> Tidal Wave <TENAME>memo</TENAME>" on May 26, 1995 <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> began to redefine its <TENAME>offerings</TENAME> and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[24] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the <TENAME>Win32</TENAME> <TENAME>API</TENAME>.[25][26] Windows 95 came bundled with the <TENAME>online</TENAME> service <TENAME>MSN</TENAME>, and for <TENAME>OEMs</TENAME> <TENAME>Internet</TENAME> <TENAME>Explorer</TENAME>, a web <TENAME>browser</TENAME>. <TENAME>Internet</TENAME> <TENAME>Explorer</TENAME> was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web <TENAME>browser</TENAME>, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[27] <TENAME>Branching</TENAME> out into new markets in 1996, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> and <TENAME>NBC</TENAME> Universal created a new 24/7 <TENAME>cable</TENAME> news station, <TENAME>MSNBC</TENAME>.[28] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> created Windows CE 1.0, a new <TENAME>OS</TENAME> designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital <TENAME>assistants</TENAME>.[29] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the <TENAME>bundling</TENAME> of <TENAME>Internet</TENAME> <TENAME>Explorer</TENAME> with Windows.[30]
<TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> handed over the <TENAME>CEO</TENAME> position on January 13, 2000 to <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> <TENAME>Ballmer</TENAME>, an old college friend of <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> and employee of the company since 1980, creating a new position for himself as Chief Software <TENAME>Architect</TENAME>.[5][31] Various companies including <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> formed the Trusted <TENAME>Computing</TENAME> Platform Alliance in October 1999 to, among other things, increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> and software. <TENAME>Critics</TENAME> decry the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, a form of digital rights management; for example the <TENAME>scenario</TENAME> where a computer is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner as well.[32][33] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v. <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>,[34] calling the company an "abusive monopoly";[35] it settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[13] On October 25, 2001 <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> released Windows <TENAME>XP</TENAME>, unifying the <TENAME>mainstream</TENAME> and NT lines under the NT codebase.[36] The company released the <TENAME>Xbox</TENAME> later that year, entering the game <TENAME>console</TENAME> market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[37] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its <TENAME>dominance</TENAME> with the Windows <TENAME>OS</TENAME>, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and to produce new versions of Windows <TENAME>XP</TENAME> without Windows Media Player, Windows <TENAME>XP</TENAME> Home Edition N and Windows <TENAME>XP</TENAME> Professional N.[38][39]

<TENAME>CEO</TENAME> <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> <TENAME>Ballmer</TENAME> at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. <TENAME>Ballmer</TENAME> also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[40]
Released in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Windows Vista, focused on features, security, and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[41][42] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a "Ribbon" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both titles helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[43] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice <TENAME>servers</TENAME>. <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> stated that it was in compliance and that "these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved".[44]
<TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> retired from his role as Chief Software <TENAME>Architect</TENAME> on June 27, 2008 while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[45] <TENAME>Azure</TENAME> Services Platform, the company's entry into the cloud <TENAME>computing</TENAME> market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[46] On February 12, 2009, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> announced its <TENAME>intent</TENAME> to open a chain of <TENAME>Microsoft-branded</TENAME> retail stores, and on October 22, 2009 the first retail <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Store opened in <TENAME>Scottsdale</TENAME>, <TENAME>Arizona</TENAME>; the same day the first store opened Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease of use features and performance enhancements, rather than a large reworking of Windows.[47][48][49]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Other founding companies include <TENAME>Google</TENAME>, <TENAME>HP</TENAME> Networking, <TENAME>Yahoo</TENAME>, <TENAME>Verizon</TENAME>, <TENAME>Deutsche</TENAME> <TENAME>Telekom</TENAME> and 17 other companies. The nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a new cloud <TENAME>computing</TENAME> initiative called <TENAME>Software-Defined</TENAME> Networking.[50] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data <TENAME>centers</TENAME> and other networking areas.[51]
Product divisions

Main article: <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Product Divisions
For the 2010 fiscal year, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> had five product divisions: Windows & Windows Live Division, <TENAME>Server</TENAME> and Tools, <TENAME>Online</TENAME> Services Division, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division.
Windows & Windows Live Division, <TENAME>Server</TENAME> and Tools, <TENAME>Online</TENAME> Services Division

The <TENAME>Online</TENAME> Services Business division handles the <TENAME>online</TENAME> service <TENAME>MSN</TENAME> and the search engine <TENAME>Bing</TENAME>. As of December 2009, the company also possesses an 18% ownership of the <TENAME>cable</TENAME> news channel <TENAME>MSNBC</TENAME> without any editorial control; however, the division develops the channel's website, <TENAME>msnbc</TENAME>.com, in a joint venture with the channel's co-owner, <TENAME>NBC</TENAME> Universal.[52]
Business Division


Front entrance to building 17 on the main <TENAME>campus</TENAME> of the company's <TENAME>Redmond</TENAME> <TENAME>campus</TENAME>.

They are targeted at varying company types and countries, and limited to organizations with under 7,500 employees.[53] Also included under the Dynamics <TENAME>brand</TENAME> is the customer relationship management software <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Dynamics CRM, part of the <TENAME>Azure</TENAME> Services Platform.
Entertainment and Devices Division
The Entertainment and Devices Division produces the Windows CE <TENAME>OS</TENAME> for embedded systems and Windows Phone 7 for <TENAME>smartphones</TENAME>.[54] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> initially entered the mobile market through Windows CE for handheld devices, eventually developing into the Windows Mobile <TENAME>OS</TENAME> and now, Windows Phone 7. Windows CE is designed for devices where the <TENAME>OS</TENAME> may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, appliances and cars. The division also produces computer games that run on Windows <TENAME>PCs</TENAME> and other systems including titles such as Age of <TENAME>Empires</TENAME>, <TENAME>Halo</TENAME> and the <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Flight Simulator series, and houses the <TENAME>Macintosh</TENAME> Business Unit which produces <TENAME>Mac</TENAME> <TENAME>OS</TENAME> software including <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Office 2011 for <TENAME>Mac</TENAME>. <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s Entertainment and Devices Division designs, markets, and manufactures consumer <TENAME>electronics</TENAME> including the <TENAME>Xbox</TENAME> 360 game <TENAME>console</TENAME>, the handheld <TENAME>Zune</TENAME> media player, and the television-based <TENAME>Internet</TENAME> appliance <TENAME>MSN</TENAME> <TENAME>TV</TENAME>. <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> also markets personal computer <TENAME>hardware</TENAME> including mice, <TENAME>keyboards</TENAME>, and various game controllers such as <TENAME>joysticks</TENAME> and <TENAME>gamepads</TENAME>.
Culture

Technical reference for <TENAME>developers</TENAME> and articles for various <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> magazines such as <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Systems <TENAME>Journal</TENAME> (or <TENAME>MSJ</TENAME>) are available through the <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Developer Network (<TENAME>MSDN</TENAME>). <TENAME>MSDN</TENAME> also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> software.[55][56] In April 2004 <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> launched a community site for <TENAME>developers</TENAME> and users, titled <TENAME>Channel9</TENAME>, that provides a wiki and an <TENAME>Internet</TENAME> forum.[57] Another community site that provides daily <TENAME>videocasts</TENAME> and other services, <TENAME>On10</TENAME>.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[58] Free technical support is traditionally provided through <TENAME>online</TENAME> <TENAME>Usenet</TENAME> <TENAME>newsgroups</TENAME>, and <TENAME>CompuServe</TENAME> in the past, monitored by <TENAME>Microsoft employees</TENAME>; there can be several <TENAME>newsgroups</TENAME> for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or <TENAME>Microsoft employees</TENAME> for <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Most Valuable Professional (<TENAME>MVP</TENAME>) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[59]
Noted for its internal lexicon, the expression "eating our own dog food" is used to describe the policy of using prerelease and beta versions of products inside <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in an effort to test them in "real-world" situations.[60] This is usually shortened to just "dog food" and is used as noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, <TENAME>FYIFV</TENAME> or <TENAME>FYIV</TENAME> ("Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[61] The company is also known for its hiring process, mimicked in other organizations and dubbed the "<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> interview", which is notorious for off-the-wall questions such as "Why is a <TENAME>manhole</TENAME> cover round?".[62]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> is an outspoken opponent of the cap on <TENAME>H1B</TENAME> visas, which allow companies in the U.S. to <TENAME>employ</TENAME> certain foreign workers. <TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> claims the cap on <TENAME>H1B</TENAME> visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating "I'd certainly get rid of the <TENAME>H1B</TENAME> cap" in 2005.[63] <TENAME>Critics</TENAME> of <TENAME>H1B</TENAME> visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to <TENAME>H1B</TENAME> workers working for lower salaries.[64] The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards <TENAME>LGBT</TENAME> (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual) employees, rated <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[65]
Corporate affairs

The company is run by a board of directors made up of mostly company <TENAME>outsiders</TENAME>, as is customary for publicly traded companies. Members of the board of directors as of June 2010 are: <TENAME>Steve</TENAME> <TENAME>Ballmer</TENAME>, <TENAME>Dina</TENAME> <TENAME>Dublon</TENAME>, <TENAME>Bill</TENAME> <TENAME>Gates</TENAME> (chairman), <TENAME>Raymond</TENAME> <TENAME>Gilmartin</TENAME>, <TENAME>Reed</TENAME> <TENAME>Hastings</TENAME>, Maria <TENAME>Klawe</TENAME>, David <TENAME>Marquardt</TENAME>, <TENAME>Charles</TENAME> <TENAME>Noski</TENAME>, and <TENAME>Helmut</TENAME> <TENAME>Panke</TENAME>.[66] Board members are elected every year at the annual <TENAME>shareholders</TENAME>' meeting using a majority vote system. There are five committees within the board which oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the <TENAME>CEO</TENAME> and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the <TENAME>Governance</TENAME> and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including nomination of the board; and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating antitrust laws.[67]

Five year history graph of (<TENAME>NASDAQ</TENAME>:<TENAME>MSFT</TENAME>) stock on September 29, 2009.[68]
When <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> went public and launched its initial public <TENAME>offering</TENAME> (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock price was $21; after the trading day, the price closed at $27.75. As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock <TENAME>splits</TENAME>, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one was to buy the IPO today given the <TENAME>splits</TENAME> and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[69][70][71] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928 adjusting for <TENAME>splits</TENAME>).[72] The company began to offer a <TENAME>dividend</TENAME> on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a <TENAME>dividend</TENAME> of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, <TENAME>switching</TENAME> from yearly to quarterly <TENAME>dividends</TENAME> in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[72][73] Though the company had subsequent increases in <TENAME>dividend</TENAME> <TENAME>payouts</TENAME>, the price of <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s stock remained steady for years.[73][74]
One of <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s business <TENAME>tactics</TENAME>, described by an <TENAME>executive</TENAME> as "embrace, extend and extinguish," initially embraces a competing standard or product, then extends it to produce their own version which is then incompatible with the standard, which in time extinguishes competition that does not or cannot use <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s new version.[75] Various companies and governments sue <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> over this set of <TENAME>tactics</TENAME>, resulting in billions of dollars in rulings against the company.[76][34][39] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> claims that the original strategy is not anti-competitive, but rather an exercise of its discretion to implement features it believes customers want.[77]
Financial
Standard and Poor's and Moody's have both given a <TENAME>AAA</TENAME> rating to <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[78]
For the first time in 20 years <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. surpassed <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> in <TENAME>Q1</TENAME> 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a <TENAME>slowdown</TENAME> in <TENAME>PC</TENAME> sales and continuing huge losses in <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s <TENAME>Online</TENAME> Services Division (which contains its search engine <TENAME>Bing</TENAME>). <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> profits were $5.2 billion, while <TENAME>Apple</TENAME> Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[79]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s <TENAME>Online</TENAME> Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in <TENAME>Q1</TENAME> 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[80]
Environment
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> is ranked on the 17th place in <TENAME>Greenpeace</TENAME>’s Guide to Greener <TENAME>Electronics</TENAME> that ranks 18 <TENAME>electronics</TENAME> manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.[81] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>’s <TENAME>timeline</TENAME> for phasing out <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME> and <TENAME>phthalates</TENAME> in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As yet (January 2011) it has no products that are completely free from PVC and <TENAME>BFRs</TENAME>.[82]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s main U.S. <TENAME>campus</TENAME> received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (<TENAME>LEED</TENAME>) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings in its <TENAME>Silicon</TENAME> Valley <TENAME>campus</TENAME>, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[83]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the worlds largest private bus systems, the "<TENAME>Connector</TENAME>", to transport people from outside the company; for <TENAME>on-campus</TENAME> transportation, the "<TENAME>Shuttle</TENAME> Connect" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The company also subsidises regional public transport as an incentive.[83][84] In February 2010 however, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> took a <TENAME>stance</TENAME> against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (<TENAME>HOV</TENAME>) lanes to a bridge connecting <TENAME>Redmond</TENAME> to <TENAME>Seattle</TENAME>; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[85]
Marketing
In 2004, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (<TENAME>TCO</TENAME>) of Windows <TENAME>Server</TENAME> 2003 to <TENAME>Linux</TENAME>; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than <TENAME>Linux</TENAME>, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower <TENAME>TCO</TENAME>).[86] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows <TENAME>Server</TENAME> to another costs a fraction of the <TENAME>switching</TENAME> costs from Windows <TENAME>Server</TENAME> to <TENAME>Linux</TENAME>, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of <TENAME>Linux</TENAME> <TENAME>servers</TENAME> and concern about being locked into using <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> products.[87] Another study, released by the <TENAME>OSDL</TENAME>, claimed that the <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the <TENAME>TCO</TENAME> of <TENAME>Linux</TENAME> was lower due to <TENAME>Linux</TENAME> administrators managing more <TENAME>servers</TENAME> on average and other reasons.[88]
As part of the "Get the Facts" campaign <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> highlighted the .NET trading platform that it had developed in partnership with <TENAME>Accenture</TENAME> for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided "five <TENAME>nines</TENAME>" reliability. After suffering extended <TENAME>downtime</TENAME> and <TENAME>unreliability</TENAME>[89][90] the <TENAME>LSE</TENAME> announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> solution and switch to a <TENAME>Linux</TENAME> based one in 2010.[91][92]
<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> adopted the so-called "<TENAME>Pac-Man</TENAME> <TENAME>Logo</TENAME>", designed by <TENAME>Scott</TENAME> Baker, in 1987. Baker stated "The new <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, in <TENAME>Helvetica</TENAME> italic <TENAME>typeface</TENAME>, has a <TENAME>slash</TENAME> between the o and s  to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed."[93] <TENAME>Dave</TENAME> <TENAME>Norris</TENAME> ran an internal <TENAME>joke</TENAME> campaign to save the old <TENAME>logo</TENAME>, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was discarded.[94] <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME>'s <TENAME>logo</TENAME> with the "Your potential. Our passion." tagline below the main corporate name, is based on a slogan <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the <TENAME>logo</TENAME> in the United States and eventually started a <TENAME>TV</TENAME> campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of "Where do you want to go today?".[95][96][97] During the private <TENAME>MGX</TENAME> (<TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> Global Exchange) conference in 2010, <TENAME>Microsoft</TENAME> unveiled the company's next tagline, "Be What's Next.", as well as a new <TENAME>logo</TENAME> scheduled for use sometime in the future.[98]
