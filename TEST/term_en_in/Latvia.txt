<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> (i/ˈlætviə/; <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: Latvija), officially the Republic of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> (<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: Latvijas Republika), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe. It is bordered to the north by Estonia (border length 343 km), to the south by Lithuania (588 km), to the east by the Russian Federation (276 km), and to the southeast by Belarus (141 km).[5] Across the Baltic Sea to the west lies Sweden. The territory of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> covers 64,589 km2 (24,938 sq mi) and it has a temperate seasonal climate.
The <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> are Baltic people culturally related to the <TENAME>Estonians</TENAME> and <TENAME>Lithuanians</TENAME>, with the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> language having many similarities with <TENAME>Lithuanian</TENAME>, but not with the <TENAME>Estonian</TENAME> language (a <TENAME>Finnic</TENAME> language). Today the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> and <TENAME>Lithuanian</TENAME> languages are the only surviving members of the Baltic languages of the <TENAME>Indo-European</TENAME> family. The modern name of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is thought to originate from the ancient <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> name <TENAME>Latvji</TENAME>, which, like the name of Lithuania, may have originated from the river named <TENAME>Latuva</TENAME>.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] The country is also the home of a large number of ethnic Russians of whom many are <TENAME>non-citizens</TENAME>.
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is a unitary parliamentary republic and is divided into 118 municipalities (109 counties and 9 cities). The capital and largest city is <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>. With a population of 2.22 million, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is one of the least-populous members of the European Union, and its population has declined 15.1% since 1991.[6] <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> has been a member of the United Nations since September 17, 1991; of the European Union since May 1, 2004; and of the NATO since March 29, 2004.
Following a period of being part of the Soviet Union after World War II, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> declared its independence in 1991. After years of economic <TENAME>stagnation</TENAME> in the early <TENAME>1990s</TENAME>, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> posted <TENAME>Europe-leading</TENAME> GDP growth figures during the 1998–2006 period. In the global financial crisis of 2008–2010 <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was the hardest <TENAME>hit</TENAME> of the European Union member states, with a GDP decline of 26.54% in that period.[7][8] Its per <TENAME>capita</TENAME> GDP is 49% of the EU average in 2009, making it the third poorest member-state.[9]

v · d · e
Around the beginning of the third millennium BC (3000 BC), the proto-Baltic ancestors of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.[10] The <TENAME>Balts</TENAME> established trade routes to <TENAME>Rome</TENAME> and <TENAME>Byzantium</TENAME>, trading local <TENAME>amber</TENAME> for precious metals.[11] By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>: <TENAME>Curonians</TENAME>, <TENAME>Latgalians</TENAME>, <TENAME>Selonians</TENAME>, <TENAME>Semigallians</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] (in <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: kurši, latgaļi, sēļi and zemgaļi), as well as the <TENAME>Livonians</TENAME> (lībieši) speaking a <TENAME>Finnic</TENAME> language.
[edit]The Medieval period
Although the local people had had contact with the outside world for centuries, they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century.[12] The first <TENAME>missionaries</TENAME>, sent by the Pope, sailed up the <TENAME>Daugava</TENAME> River in the late 12th century, seeking <TENAME>converts</TENAME>.[13] The local people, however, did not convert to <TENAME>Christianity</TENAME> as readily as hoped.[13] German <TENAME>crusaders</TENAME> were sent into <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> to convert the pagan population by force of arms.[14]
In the beginning of the 13th century, large parts of today's <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> were occupied by <TENAME>Germans</TENAME>.[13] Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the <TENAME>crusader</TENAME> state that became known as <TENAME>Terra</TENAME> <TENAME>Mariana</TENAME> or <TENAME>Livonia</TENAME>. In 1282, <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>, and later the cities of <TENAME>Cēsis</TENAME>, <TENAME>Limbaži</TENAME>, <TENAME>Koknese</TENAME> and <TENAME>Valmiera</TENAME>, were included in the <TENAME>Hanseatic</TENAME> League.[13] <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> became an important point of east-west trading.[13] and formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
[edit]The <TENAME>Reformation</TENAME> period
The 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, including the <TENAME>reformation</TENAME>, the collapse of the <TENAME>Livonian</TENAME> state, and the time when the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> territory was divided up among foreign powers.
After the <TENAME>Livonian</TENAME> War (1558–1583), <TENAME>Livonia</TENAME> (<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>) fell under Polish and <TENAME>Lithuanian</TENAME> rule.[13] The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> were ceded to the Grand <TENAME>Duchy of</TENAME> Lithuania and formed into the <TENAME>Ducatus</TENAME> <TENAME>Ultradunensis</TENAME> (<TENAME>Pārdaugavas</TENAME> hercogiste). <TENAME>Gotthard</TENAME> <TENAME>Kettler</TENAME>, the last Master of the Order of <TENAME>Livonia</TENAME>, formed the <TENAME>Duchy of Courland</TENAME> and <TENAME>Semigallia</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. Though the <TENAME>duchy</TENAME> was a <TENAME>vassal</TENAME> state to Poland, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century. <TENAME>Latgalia</TENAME>, the easternmost region of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, became a part of the Polish district of <TENAME>Inflanty</TENAME>.
The 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between Polish–<TENAME>Lithuanian</TENAME> <TENAME>Commonwealth</TENAME>, Sweden and Russia for <TENAME>supremacy</TENAME> in the eastern Baltic. After the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611), northern <TENAME>Livonia</TENAME> (including <TENAME>Vidzeme</TENAME>) came under Swedish rule. Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the <TENAME>Truce</TENAME> of <TENAME>Altmark</TENAME> in 1629[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. In <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive; <TENAME>serfdom</TENAME> was eased, a network of schools was established for the <TENAME>peasantry</TENAME>, and the power of the regional <TENAME>barons</TENAME> was diminished.[15][16]

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> adopted <TENAME>Lutheranism</TENAME> as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the <TENAME>Couronians</TENAME>, <TENAME>Semigallians</TENAME>, <TENAME>Selonians</TENAME>, <TENAME>Livs</TENAME> and northern <TENAME>Latgallians</TENAME> assimilated to form the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> people, speaking one <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> language. Throughout all the centuries, however, no such thing as a <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, southern <TENAME>Latgallians</TENAME> adopted <TENAME>Catholicism</TENAME> under Polish/Jesuit influence. The native <TENAME>dialect</TENAME> remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian <TENAME>loanwords</TENAME>.[17]
[edit]<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> in the Russian <TENAME>Empire</TENAME>
The <TENAME>Capitulation</TENAME> of Estonia and <TENAME>Livonia</TENAME> in 1710 and the Treaty of <TENAME>Nystad</TENAME>, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave <TENAME>Vidzeme</TENAME> to Russia (it became part of the <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> <TENAME>Governorate</TENAME>)[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. The <TENAME>Latgale</TENAME> region remained part of the Polish–<TENAME>Lithuanian</TENAME> <TENAME>Commonwealth</TENAME> as <TENAME>Inflanty</TENAME> <TENAME>Voivodeship</TENAME> until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The <TENAME>Duchy of Courland</TENAME> and <TENAME>Semigallia</TENAME> became an autonomous Russian province (the <TENAME>Courland</TENAME> <TENAME>Governorate</TENAME>) in 1795, bringing all of what is now <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> into the Russian <TENAME>Empire</TENAME>. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, the local official language and their own parliament, the <TENAME>Landtag</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), the Baltic area was once again the scene of great <TENAME>devastation</TENAME>, with <TENAME>Peter</TENAME> the Great's scorched-earth policy, famine, and <TENAME>plague</TENAME> being responsible for catastrophic loss of human life: as much as 40% of the population in <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> lands were killed.[18] In 1710, the <TENAME>plague</TENAME> reached <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>, where it was active until 1711 and claimed the lives of about half the population.[19]
The promises <TENAME>Peter</TENAME> the Great made to the Baltic German nobility at the fall of <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of <TENAME>Nystad</TENAME> and known as "the <TENAME>Capitulations</TENAME>", largely reversed the Swedish reforms[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
The <TENAME>emancipation</TENAME> of the <TENAME>serfs</TENAME> took place in <TENAME>Courland</TENAME> in 1817 and in <TENAME>Vidzeme</TENAME> in 1819[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. In practice, however, the <TENAME>emancipation</TENAME> was actually advantageous to the <TENAME>landowners</TENAME> and nobility[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed], as it dispossessed <TENAME>peasants</TENAME> of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will".
During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the <TENAME>peasants</TENAME> to repurchase their land, but many landless <TENAME>peasants</TENAME> remained[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> bourgeoisie. The Young <TENAME>Latvian </TENAME>(<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: <TENAME>Jaunlatvieši</TENAME>) movement laid the <TENAME>groundwork</TENAME> for <TENAME>nationalism</TENAME> from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the <TENAME>Slavophiles</TENAME> for support against the prevailing <TENAME>German-dominated</TENAME> social order[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. The rise in use of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening. <TENAME>Russification</TENAME> began in <TENAME>Latgale</TENAME> after the Polish led the January <TENAME>Uprising</TENAME> in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> by the <TENAME>1880s</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. The Young <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> were largely eclipsed by the New Current, a broad <TENAME>leftist</TENAME> social and political movement, in the <TENAME>1890s</TENAME>. Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.

World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, along with other western parts of the Russian <TENAME>Empire</TENAME>. Demands for <TENAME>self-determination</TENAME> were at first confined to autonomy, but the Russian 1917 Revolution, treaty with Germany at <TENAME>Brest-Litovsk</TENAME>, and allied <TENAME>armistice</TENAME> with Germany on November 11, 1918, created a power vacuum. The People's Council of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> proclaimed the independence of the new country in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> on November 18, 1918, with <TENAME>Kārlis</TENAME> <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME> becoming the head of the provisional government[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
The War of Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments — <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME>' government; the Soviet <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> government led by <TENAME>Pēteris</TENAME> <TENAME>Stučka</TENAME>, whose forces, supported by the Red Army, occupied almost all of the country; and the Baltic German government of the United Baltic <TENAME>Duchy</TENAME>, headed by <TENAME>Andrievs</TENAME> <TENAME>Niedra</TENAME> and supported by the <TENAME>Baltische</TENAME> <TENAME>Landeswehr</TENAME> and the German <TENAME>Freikorps</TENAME> unit Iron Division.
<TENAME>Estonian</TENAME> and <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> forces[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] defeated the <TENAME>Germans</TENAME> at the Battle of <TENAME>Wenden</TENAME> in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly German force — the West Russian Volunteer Army — under <TENAME>Pavel</TENAME> <TENAME>Bermondt-Avalov</TENAME> was repelled in November. Eastern <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was cleared of Red Army forces by <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the Battle of <TENAME>Daugavpils</TENAME> was a part of the <TENAME>Polish-Soviet</TENAME> War)[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on May 1, 1920, and adopted a liberal constitution, the <TENAME>Satversme</TENAME>, in February 1922.[20] The constitution was partly suspended by <TENAME>Kārlis</TENAME> <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME> after his <TENAME>coup</TENAME> in 1934, but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> today. With most of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.[21]
By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level. Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great <TENAME>Depression</TENAME>. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> showed signs of economic recovery and the <TENAME>electorate</TENAME> had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. On May 15, 1934, <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME> staged a bloodless <TENAME>coup</TENAME>, establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940.[22] After 1934, <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME> established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of "<TENAME>Latvianising</TENAME>" the economy.[23] By 1940, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s economy under <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME> ranked second in Europe.[24]

"TWO WORLDS": <TENAME>Anti-Sovietism</TENAME> propaganda board, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, Summer, 1941.
Early in the morning of August 24, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the <TENAME>Molotov</TENAME>–<TENAME>Ribbentrop</TENAME> Pact. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "<TENAME>spheres</TENAME> of influence".[25] In the North, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet <TENAME>sphere</TENAME>.[25] Thereafter, Germany and the Soviet union invaded their respective portions of Poland.
Most of the Baltic <TENAME>Germans</TENAME> left <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> by agreement between <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME>' government and Nazi Germany after the conclusion of the <TENAME>Molotov-Ribbentrop</TENAME> Pact.[26] In total 50,000 Baltic <TENAME>Germans</TENAME> left by the deadline of December 1939, with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>.[26] Most of those who remained subsequently left for Germany in the Summer of 1939, when a second <TENAME>resettlement</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] scheme was agreed.[27] On October 5, 1939, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the <TENAME>Soviets</TENAME> the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> territory.[28]
On 5 October 1939 the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> government under pressure from the <TENAME>USSR</TENAME> permitted the building of Soviet military bases, intended to defend <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> from possible aggression by Germany. On 16 June 1940 the government of the <TENAME>USSR</TENAME> handed the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> ambassador in <TENAME>Moscow</TENAME> a note, in which <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939 and demands were made to send in additional Soviet troops and to change the government. The <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> government obeyed and resigned. On 17 June, Soviet troops entered <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> territory. In his address by radio, the <TENAME>dictator</TENAME> of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, <TENAME>Kārlis</TENAME> <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME>, announced: “Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning. This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government, which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> and the Soviet Union. It is, therefore, my wish that the <TENAME>residents</TENAME> of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units … The government has resigned. I shall remain in my place, you remain in yours”. No opposition was shown towards the Soviet forces; on the contrary, part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm, which was evidenced by the crowded pro-Soviet demonstrations. Observing them, the well known Russian lawyer and public figure of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, <TENAME>Pyotr</TENAME> <TENAME>Yakobi</TENAME>, wrote: “Taken from the German model, the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national <TENAME>bureaucracy</TENAME>, having satisfied a limited circle of citizens, who have adapted themselves to the state <TENAME>pie</TENAME>. Clearly, any hardship is not in vain. And so now the down-trodden have raised their voice and demand a return of their rights that have been trampled on … “. Among those unhappy with the regime of <TENAME>Kārlis</TENAME> <TENAME>Ulmanis</TENAME> were not only the national minorities but also many <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and who had no desire to end up under the rule of Nazi Germany.
State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet <TENAME>cadres</TENAME>,[29] in which 34,250 <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> were deported or killed.[30] Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions; the resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the <TENAME>USSR</TENAME>, which was granted by the Soviet Union.[29] <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, then a <TENAME>puppet</TENAME> government, was headed by <TENAME>Augusts</TENAME> <TENAME>Kirhenšteins</TENAME>.[31] <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 5, 1940 as The <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> Soviet Socialist Republic.
The <TENAME>Soviets</TENAME> dealt harshly with their opponents – prior to the German invasion, in the course of less than a year, at least 27,586 persons were arrested; most were deported, and about 945 persons were shot[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. While under German occupation, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was administered as part of <TENAME>Reichskommissariat</TENAME> <TENAME>Ostland</TENAME>. <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the <TENAME>Holocaust</TENAME> as well.[22] More than 200,000 <TENAME>Latvian citizens</TENAME> died during World War II, including approximately 75,000 <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> Jews murdered during the Nazi occupation.[22] <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict, including in the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> Legion of the <TENAME>Waffen-SS</TENAME>, most of them conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
[edit]Soviet <TENAME>era</TENAME>
Main articles: Occupation of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> by Soviet Union 1944–1945, <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> Soviet Socialist Republic, and <TENAME>Stalinism</TENAME>
In 1944 when the Soviet military advances reached the area heavy fighting took place in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> between German and Soviet troops which ended with another German defeat. During the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's "live resources". In 1944, part of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> territory once more came under Soviet control. The <TENAME>Soviets</TENAME> immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After the German surrender it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> national <TENAME>partisans</TENAME>, soon to be joined by German <TENAME>collaborators</TENAME>, began their fight against another <TENAME>occupier</TENAME> – the Soviet Union.[32]
Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> took <TENAME>refuge</TENAME> from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden.[33] Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the <TENAME>Soviets</TENAME> or, during few months immediately after the end of war,[34] returned by the West.[35] The <TENAME>Soviets</TENAME> reoccupied the country in 1944–1945, and further mass deportations followed as the country was forcibly collectivised and <TENAME>Sovieticised</TENAME>.[22]
On March 25, 1949, 43,000 rich <TENAME>residents</TENAME> ("<TENAME>kulaks</TENAME>") and <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> patriots ("<TENAME>nationalists</TENAME>") were deported to Siberia in a sweeping repressive Operation <TENAME>Priboi</TENAME> in all three Baltic states, which was carefully planned and approved in <TENAME>Moscow</TENAME> already on January 29, 1949.[36] Between 136,000 and 190,000 <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME>, depending on the sources, were imprisoned, repressed or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the <TENAME>Gulag</TENAME>) in the post war years, from 1945 to 1952.[37] Some managed to escape arrest and joined the <TENAME>partisans</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed].
In the post-war period, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was forced to adopt Soviet farming methods and the economic infrastructure developed in the <TENAME>1920s</TENAME> and <TENAME>1930s</TENAME> was eradicated[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. Rural areas were forced into <TENAME>collectivisation</TENAME>.[38] An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, limiting the use of <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> language in official uses in favor of using the official language, which was Russian. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, <TENAME>Belorussian</TENAME>, <TENAME>Estonian</TENAME>, <TENAME>Lithuanian</TENAME>) were closed down leaving only two languages of instructions in the schools- <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> and Russian.[39] An <TENAME>influx</TENAME> of <TENAME>labourers</TENAME>, administrators, military personnel and their <TENAME>dependents</TENAME> from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 persons arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> population had fallen to 62%.[40]
Because <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> had still maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists it was decided in <TENAME>Moscow</TENAME> that some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing factories were to be based in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>. New industry was created in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, including a major machinery factory <TENAME>RAF</TENAME> in <TENAME>Jelgava</TENAME>, electrotechnical factories in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>, chemical factories in <TENAME>Daugavpils</TENAME>, <TENAME>Valmiera</TENAME> and <TENAME>Olaine</TENAME>, as well as some food and oil processing plants.[41] However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. In order to expand industrial production, skilled workers were transferred into the republic from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> in the republic.[42]
[edit]Restoration of independence


Barricade in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> to prevent the Soviet Army from reaching the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> Parliament, July 1991.
In the second half of <TENAME>1980s</TENAME> Soviet leader <TENAME>Mikhail</TENAME> <TENAME>Gorbachev</TENAME> started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union, called <TENAME>glasnost</TENAME> and <TENAME>Perestroika</TENAME>. In the summer of 1987 the first large demonstrations were held in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> at the Freedom Monument- a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988 a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, was opposed by the <TENAME>Interfront</TENAME>. The <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988 the old pre-war Flag of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> was allowed to be used, replacing the Soviet <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> flag as the official flag in 1990.
In 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the <TENAME>USSR</TENAME> adopted a resolution on the "Occupation of the Baltic states", in which it declared that the occupation was "not in accordance with law," and not the "will of the Soviet people". <TENAME>Pro-independence</TENAME> Popular Front of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections. On May 4, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> SSR adopted the Declaration On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> SSR was renamed Republic of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>.
However, the central power in <TENAME>Moscow</TENAME> continued to regard <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> as Soviet republic in 1990–1991[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> authorities by occupying the central <TENAME>publishing</TENAME> house in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> and establishing a Committee of National <TENAME>Salvation</TENAME> to usurp governmental functions[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. During the transitional period <TENAME>Moscow</TENAME> maintained many central Soviet state authorities in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>.
In <TENAME>spite</TENAME> of this, 73% of all <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> residents confirmed their strong support for independence on March 3, 1991, in a nonbinding advisory <TENAME>referendum</TENAME>[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. A large number of ethnic Russians also voted for the proposition[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]. The Popular Front of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> had advocated that all permanent <TENAME>residents</TENAME> be eligible for <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> citizenship. However, universal <TENAME>citizenship</TENAME> for all permanent <TENAME>residents</TENAME> was not adopted subsequently; not all those who had voted in support of independence received <TENAME>citizenship</TENAME> in the new <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> state and became <TENAME>non-citizens</TENAME>. (The majority of <TENAME>non-citizens</TENAME> have since become naturalized citizens.) The Republic of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on August 21, 1991 in the <TENAME>aftermath</TENAME> of the failed Soviet <TENAME>coup</TENAME> attempt.[2]


<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.
The <TENAME>Saeima</TENAME>, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s parliament, was again elected in 1993, and Russia completed its military withdrawal in 1994. The major goals of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> in the <TENAME>1990s</TENAME>, to join NATO and the European Union, were achieved in 2004.
Language and <TENAME>citizenship</TENAME> laws have been opposed by many <TENAME>Russophones</TENAME>. (<TENAME>Citizenship</TENAME> was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation or to their subsequent offspring. This resulted in a situation where people who have lived and worked in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> for over 50 years were nonetheless unable to vote, which meant that Russian voice was largely excluded from the parliament and the government.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] Children born to <TENAME>non-nationals</TENAME> after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to <TENAME>citizenship</TENAME>.) Approximately 72% of <TENAME>Latvian citizens</TENAME> are <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>, while 20% are Russian; less than 1% of <TENAME>non-citizens</TENAME> are <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>, while 71% are Russian.[43] The government denationalised private property confiscated by the Soviet rule, returning it or compensating the owners for it, and privatised most state-owned industries, reintroducing the prewar currency. <TENAME>Albeit</TENAME> having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal economy and its re-orientation toward Western Europe, its economy had one of the highest growth rates until the 2008–2010 <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> financial crisis.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]
[edit]Geography

Main article: Geography of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>


Map of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> showing cities
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> lies mostly between latitudes 55° and 58° N (a small area is north of 58°), and longitudes 21° and 29° E (a small area is west of 21°).
Located on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> lies on the East European Plain. However, its vegetation is much different than the rest of the plain and shares many similarities with the boreal <TENAME>biome</TENAME>. It consists of fertile, low-lying plains, largely covered by forest, mostly pines, the highest point being the <TENAME>Gaiziņkalns</TENAME> at 311.6 m (1,022 <TENAME>ft</TENAME>).
<TENAME>Phytogeographically</TENAME>, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is shared between the Central European and Northern European provinces of the <TENAME>Circumboreal</TENAME> Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the <TENAME>WWF</TENAME>, the territory of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> belongs to the ecoregion of <TENAME>Sarmatic</TENAME> mixed forests. The major rivers include the <TENAME>Daugava</TENAME> River, the <TENAME>Lielupe</TENAME>, the <TENAME>Gauja</TENAME>, the <TENAME>Venta</TENAME>, and the <TENAME>Salaca</TENAME>. An <TENAME>inlet</TENAME> of the Baltic Sea, the shallow Gulf of <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> is situated in the <TENAME>northwest</TENAME> of the country. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s <TENAME>coastline</TENAME> extends for 531 kilometres.

Main article: Administrative divisions of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
See also: List of cities in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, Planning regions of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, and Historical regions of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
Since 2009 <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> has one-level municipalities – 9 republican cities (<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: republikas pilsētas) (<TENAME>Daugavpils</TENAME>, Jēkabpils, <TENAME>Jelgava</TENAME>, Jūrmala, <TENAME>Liepāja</TENAME>, <TENAME>Rēzekne</TENAME>, <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>, <TENAME>Valmiera</TENAME>, <TENAME>Ventspils</TENAME>) and 110 municipalities (<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: novadi). There are four historical and cultural regions in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> – <TENAME>Courland</TENAME>, <TENAME>Latgalia</TENAME>, <TENAME>Vidzeme</TENAME>, <TENAME>Zemgale</TENAME>. Their borders usually are not explicit definite and in several sources may vary. To promote balanced development of all regions, in 2009 five planning regions of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> (<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: plānošanas reģioni) were created:

<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>	<TENAME>Riga</TENAME>	64,256 km²	2,248,000 – (34.9/km²)
[edit]Climate
The <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> climate is humid, continental and temperate owing to the maritime influence of the Baltic Sea. Summers are warm, and the weather in spring and <TENAME>autumn</TENAME> is fairly mild; however, the winters can be extreme due to the northern location. Precipitation is common throughout the year with the heaviest <TENAME>rainfall</TENAME> in July. During severe spells of winter weather, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is dominated by cold winds from the interior of Russia, and severe <TENAME>snowfalls</TENAME> are very common.
[edit]<TENAME>Biodiversity</TENAME>


View from atop the tower of <TENAME>Gaizinkalns</TENAME>
Common species of wildlife in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> include deer, wild boar, <TENAME>moose</TENAME>, <TENAME>lynx</TENAME>, bear, <TENAME>fox</TENAME>, <TENAME>beaver</TENAME> and <TENAME>wolves</TENAME>.[44] <TENAME>Non-marine</TENAME> molluscs of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> include 159 species.
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s national trees are <TENAME>oak</TENAME> (<TENAME>Quercus</TENAME> robur), <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: <TENAME>ozols</TENAME>, and <TENAME>linden </TENAME>(<TENAME>Tilia</TENAME> <TENAME>cordata</TENAME>), <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: <TENAME>liepa</TENAME>. <TENAME>Oaks</TENAME> and <TENAME>Lindens</TENAME> are considered the national trees of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>. The <TENAME>oak</TENAME> and the <TENAME>linden tree</TENAME> are characteristic elements of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> landscape. Both trees are still widely used for medical purposes. Medicinal <TENAME>infusions</TENAME> are made of <TENAME>linden</TENAME> blossoms as well as <TENAME>oak</TENAME> <TENAME>bark</TENAME>. <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> dainas (<TENAME>folk songs</TENAME>) often reflect ethical and moral concepts of earlier times. Amongst other trees, these <TENAME>folk songs</TENAME> most often mention the <TENAME>oak</TENAME> and <TENAME>linden tree</TENAME>. In traditional <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> folk beliefs and <TENAME>folklore</TENAME> the <TENAME>linden tree</TENAME> is looked upon as a female symbol, but the <TENAME>oak</TENAME> – a male symbol. The nation's reverence for these trees, which in earlier times were considered sacred, can be witnessed, for example, in a landscape where, in the middle of a cultivated field there still remains a lone large, sacred <TENAME>oak</TENAME> or <TENAME>linden tree</TENAME>.


The White <TENAME>Wagtail</TENAME> is the national bird of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s national bird is the White <TENAME>Wagtail</TENAME> (<TENAME>Motacilla</TENAME> alba), <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: baltā <TENAME>cielava</TENAME>. This slender and graceful bird is found in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> from April till October. The White <TENAME>Wagtail</TENAME> can usually be seen running briskly along the ground, wagging its tail up and down. This bird typically nests in the <TENAME>rafters</TENAME> and <TENAME>eaves</TENAME> of buildings, <TENAME>woodpiles</TENAME>, stone piles, and <TENAME>birdhouses</TENAME>. During the winter it migrates to Southern Europe and North Africa. The White <TENAME>Wagtail</TENAME> was affirmed the national bird of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> in 1960 by the International Bird Protection Council.
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s national flower is the <TENAME>oxeye</TENAME> <TENAME>daisy</TENAME> (<TENAME>Leucanthemum</TENAME> vulgare also known as <TENAME>Chrysanthemum</TENAME> <TENAME>leucanthemum</TENAME>), <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: pīpene.[45] In <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> conditions, the common or wild <TENAME>daisy</TENAME> blossoms from June till September. <TENAME>Daisies</TENAME> are a very popular flower and are often used in flower arrangements or given as gifts.
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s national insect is the <TENAME>Two-spot</TENAME> <TENAME>ladybird</TENAME> (<TENAME>Adalia</TENAME> <TENAME>bipunctata</TENAME>), <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>: mārīte. The <TENAME>two-spot</TENAME> <TENAME>ladybird</TENAME> is familiar as a useful insect that protects plants from parasites. Although rather slow by nature, it can defend itself well. Due to its appearance and behaviour it is widely known and liked throughout <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>. The insect's <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> name – marite – is a synonym for the ancient <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> goddess <TENAME>Mara</TENAME>, who embodies the power of the earth. The <TENAME>two-spot</TENAME> <TENAME>ladybird</TENAME> was designated the national insect of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> by the Entomological Society of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>.
[edit]Politics

Main articles: Politics of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, Parliament of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, and Government of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
The 100-seat unicameral <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> parliament, the <TENAME>Saeima</TENAME>, is elected by direct popular vote every four years. The president is elected by the <TENAME>Saeima</TENAME> in a separate election, also held every four years. The president appoints a prime minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the <TENAME>executive branch</TENAME> of the government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the <TENAME>Saeima</TENAME>. This system also existed before World War II.[46] Highest civil servants are sixteen Secretaries of State.
[edit]Foreign relations
Main article: Foreign relations of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>


<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> has a representation in the European parliament since 2004.
Membership in the EU and NATO were major policy goals during the <TENAME>1990s</TENAME>. In a nation-wide <TENAME>referendum</TENAME> on September 20, 2003, 66.9% of those taking part voted in favour of joining the European Union. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> became a member of the European Union on May 1, 2004. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> has been a NATO member since March 29, 2004.
The Treaty delimiting the boundary with Russia was signed and ratified in 2007. Under the treaty the <TENAME>Abrene</TENAME> district passed to Russia; talks over maritime boundary disputes with Lithuania are ongoing (the primary concern is oil exploration rights).
[edit]Human rights
Main article: Human rights in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
Human rights in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> are generally respected by the government.[47][48] <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is ranked above-average among the world's sovereign states in democracy,[49] press freedom,[50] privacy [51] and human development.[52] The country has a large ethnic Russian community, which was guaranteed basic rights under the constitution and international human rights laws ratified by the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> government.[47][53]
However, human rights organisations have reported multiple problems. Especially <TENAME>non-citizens</TENAME> – including stateless persons – suffer from limited or no access to a broad range of rights. Also there were problems with police abuse of <TENAME>detainees</TENAME> and <TENAME>arrestees</TENAME>, poor prison conditions and overcrowding, judicial corruption, discrimination against women, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and societal violence and incidents of government discrimination against <TENAME>homosexuals</TENAME>.[47][54][55]

<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s defence concept is based upon the <TENAME>Swedish-Finnish</TENAME> model of a rapid response force composed of a <TENAME>mobilization</TENAME> base and a small group of <TENAME>career</TENAME> professionals. The armed forces consist of mobile <TENAME>riflemen</TENAME>, an air force, and a <TENAME>navy</TENAME>. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> cooperates with Estonia and Lithuania in the joint <TENAME>infantry</TENAME> <TENAME>battalion</TENAME> <TENAME>BALTBAT</TENAME> and naval <TENAME>squadron</TENAME> <TENAME>BALTRON</TENAME> which are available for peacekeeping operations.
As of March 29, 2004, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> officially joined NATO. Currently, NATO is involved in the patrolling and protection of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> air space as the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> army does not have the means to do so effectively. For this goal a rotating force of four NATO <TENAME>fighters</TENAME>, which comes from different nations and switches at two or three month intervals, is based in Lithuania to cover all three Baltic states (see Baltic Air Policing).
[edit]Economy

Main article: Economy of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>


A high rise building
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is a member of the World Trade Organization (1999) and the European Union (2004).
Since the year 2000 <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in Europe.[56] However, the chiefly consumption-driven growth in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> resulted in the collapse of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> GDP in late 2008 and early 2009, exacerbated by the global economic crisis and shortage of credit. <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009, the biggest fall in the European Union.[57][58] According to Eurostat data, <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> PPS GDP per <TENAME>capita</TENAME> stood at 56 per cent of the EU average in 2008.[59]


Real GDP growth in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> 1996–2006.
This latest <TENAME>scenario</TENAME> has proven the earlier assumptions that the fast growing economy was heading for <TENAME>implosion</TENAME> of the economic bubble, because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption, financed by a serious increase of private debt, as well as a negative foreign trade balance. The prices of real estate, which were at some points appreciating at approximately 5% a month, were long perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low-value goods and raw materials.
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> plans to introduce the Euro as the country's currency but, due to the <TENAME>inflation</TENAME> being above <TENAME>EMU</TENAME>'s guidelines, the government's official target is now January 1, 2012. However in October 2007, with <TENAME>inflation</TENAME> above 11%, the head of the National Bank of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> suggested that 2013 may be a more realistic date.[60]
<TENAME>Privatization</TENAME> in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been successfully privatized, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> privatization efforts have led to the development of a dynamic and prosperous private sector, which accounted for nearly 68% of GDP in 2000.
Foreign investment in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the same year, the United States exported $58.2 million of goods and services to <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions like the World Trade Organization, OECD, and the European Union, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995—with a 4-year transition period. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation.
[edit]Economic <TENAME>contraction</TENAME>
Main article: 2008–2010 <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> financial crisis


<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is part of the Schengen Area and the EU single market.
The <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> economy entered a phase of fiscal <TENAME>contraction</TENAME> during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values. The national account deficit for 2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while <TENAME>inflation</TENAME> was running at 10%.[5]
<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22%.[61] In April 2010 <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> had the highest unemployment rate in the EU, at 22.5%, ahead of Spain which had 19.7%.[62]
<TENAME>Paul</TENAME> <TENAME>Krugman</TENAME>, the <TENAME>Nobel</TENAME> <TENAME>Laureate</TENAME> in economics for 2008, wrote in his New York Times <TENAME>Op-Ed</TENAME> column for December 15, 2008:
"The most acute problems are on Europe’s <TENAME>periphery</TENAME>, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia: <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is the new Argentina " [63]
However by 2010 <TENAME>commentators</TENAME>[64][65] noted signs of stabilisation in the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> economy. Rating agency Standard & Poor's raised its outlook on <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s debt from negative to stable.[64] <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s current account, which had been in deficit by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010.[64] <TENAME>Kenneth</TENAME> Orchard, senior analyst at Moody's <TENAME>investors</TENAME> service argued that:
"The strengthening regional economy is supporting <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> production and exports, while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the country’s ‘internal <TENAME>devaluation</TENAME>’ is working." [66]
The IMF however warned that tax revenues were likely to be eroded due to price and wage decreases continuing until 2012,[65] adding that:
"The sharp economic <TENAME>downturn</TENAME> is starting to bottom out, but recovery has not yet begun and sizable risks remain."[65]

The transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia and the West is large.[67]
Key ports are in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>, <TENAME>Ventspils</TENAME>, and <TENAME>Liepāja</TENAME>. Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products.[67]
<TENAME>Riga</TENAME> International Airport is the largest airport with 4.7 million passengers in 2010.

<TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>'s population has been multiethnic for centuries, though the <TENAME>demographics</TENAME> shifted dramatically in the twentieth century due to the World Wars, the <TENAME>emigration</TENAME> and removal of Baltic <TENAME>Germans</TENAME>, the <TENAME>Holocaust</TENAME>, and occupation by the Soviet Union. According to the Russian <TENAME>Empire</TENAME> Census of 1897, <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, <TENAME>Germans</TENAME> for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%.[69]
<TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> and <TENAME>Livonians</TENAME>, the indigenous peoples of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, now form about 59.49% of the population; 27.37% of the inhabitants are Russians, <TENAME>Belarusians</TENAME> 3.52%, <TENAME>Ukrainians</TENAME> 2.45%, Poles 2.31%, <TENAME>Lithuanians</TENAME> 1.32%, Jews 0.43%, <TENAME>Roma</TENAME> people 0.38%, <TENAME>Germans</TENAME> 0.2%, <TENAME>Estonians</TENAME> 0.1% and others 2.43%.[68]
In some large cities, e.g. <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>, <TENAME>Daugavpils</TENAME> and <TENAME>Rēzekne</TENAME>, Russians and other minorities outnumber <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME>. Minorities from other countries such as Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, etc., also live in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>. The share of ethnic <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> had fallen from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989.[70] In 2005 there were even fewer <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> than in 1989, though their share of the population was larger — 1,357,099 (60.% of the inhabitants).[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]
[edit]Language
Further information: Language policy in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
The sole official language of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>, which belongs to the Baltic language group of the <TENAME>Indo-European</TENAME> language family. Another notable language of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is the nearly extinct <TENAME>Livonian</TENAME> language of the <TENAME>Finnic</TENAME> branch of the <TENAME>Uralic</TENAME> language family, which enjoys protection by law; <TENAME>Latgalian</TENAME> — a <TENAME>dialect</TENAME> of <TENAME>Latvian </TENAME>— is also protected by <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> law as a historical variation of the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> language. Russian, which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, and also during the Russian Imperial period, is by far the most widely used minority language, and is understood by virtually all <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> who started their education during the period of Soviet rule. While it is now required that all school students learn <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME>, most schools also include English and either German or Russian in their curricula. The English language is widely accepted in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> especially in business and tourism.
[edit]Religion

<TENAME>Riga</TENAME> <TENAME>Cathedral</TENAME>
The largest religion in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is <TENAME>Christianity</TENAME>,[5] though only about 7% of the population attends religious services regularly.[71] The largest groups as of 2006 were:
Evangelical Lutheran Church of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> – 450,000[72]
Roman Catholic – 430,000[72]
Orthodox – 350,000[72]
In the <TENAME>Eurobarometer</TENAME> <TENAME>Poll</TENAME> 2005,[73] 37% of <TENAME>Latvian citizens</TENAME> responded that "they believe there is a god", while 49% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 10% stated that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".
<TENAME>Lutheranism</TENAME> was much stronger before the Soviet <TENAME>annexation</TENAME>, when it was a majority religion. Since then, <TENAME>Lutheranism</TENAME> has declined to a much greater extent than Roman <TENAME>Catholicism</TENAME> in all three Baltic states. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of March 18, 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, but the faith has since experienced a <TENAME>revival</TENAME>.[74] The country's Orthodox <TENAME>Christians</TENAME> belong to the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> Orthodox Church, a semi-autonomous body within the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2011, there were 9,571 Jews and 182 <TENAME>Muslims</TENAME> living in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>.
There are more than 600 <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> neopagans, <TENAME>Dievturi</TENAME> (The <TENAME>Godskeepers</TENAME>), whose religion is based on <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> mythology.[75] About 40% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]

University of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>
<TENAME>Riga</TENAME> Technical University and University of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> are two major universities in the country, both been established on the basis of <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> <TENAME>Polytechnical</TENAME> Institute and located in <TENAME>Riga</TENAME>.[76] <TENAME>Riga</TENAME> <TENAME>Stradiņš</TENAME> University was established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine of the State University of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME>, but nowadays covers a variety of various fields. <TENAME>Daugavpils</TENAME> University is another important <TENAME>center</TENAME> of education. <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010, which is a 12.9% decline, and in the same period <TENAME>enrollment</TENAME> in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people, a 10.3% decline.[77] Another well known university in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> is <TENAME>LLU</TENAME>(<TENAME>Latvias</TENAME> lauksaimniecibas universitate)(<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> university of Agriculture). It is located in <TENAME>Jelgava</TENAME>.[78]
[edit]Health
The <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> healthcare system is a universal program, largely funded through government taxation.[79] It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors.[80] There were 59 hospitals in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006.[81][82][83] The average life expectancy at birth is 72.7 years, second lowest in the European Union.[84]
Corruption is relatively widespread in the <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> healthcare system, though the situation has improved since the early <TENAME>1990s</TENAME>. It has been noted that an environment conducive to corruption has been promulgated by low salaries and poorly implemented systemic reforms.[85] This also results in brain drain, mostly to Western EU nations.
As of 2007, there were approximately 10,000 inhabitants of <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> living with HIV/AIDS.[5] There were 32,376 (1.44%) individual instances of clinically reported <TENAME>alcoholism</TENAME> in <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> in 2008, as well as cases of <TENAME>addictions</TENAME> to other substances.[86] The annual number of births per 1,000 adolescent women aged 15 to 19 has declined from 49,9 in 1990 to 17,9 in 2007.[87] In 2005, <TENAME>Latvia</TENAME> had a suicide rate of 24.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (down from 40.7 in 1995), the 7th highest in the world.[88]

<TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> country scenery in <TENAME>Sabile</TENAME>
Traditional <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> folklore, especially the dance of the <TENAME>folk songs</TENAME> date back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 <TENAME>melodies</TENAME> of <TENAME>folk songs</TENAME> have been identified.[89]
Between the thirteenth and nineteenth century, Baltic <TENAME>Germans</TENAME>, many of whom were originally of non-German <TENAME>ancestry</TENAME> but had been assimilated into German culture, formed the upper class.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] They developed distinct cultural heritage, characterised by both <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> and German influences. It has survived in German Baltic families to this day, in <TENAME>spite</TENAME> of their dispersal to Germany, the USA, Canada and other countries in the early 20th century. However, most indigenous <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> did not participate in this particular cultural life.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] Thus, the mostly <TENAME>peasant</TENAME> local pagan heritage was preserved, partly merging with Christian traditions, for example in one of the most popular <TENAME>celebrations</TENAME> today which is <TENAME>Jāņi</TENAME>, a pagan <TENAME>celebration</TENAME> of the summer <TENAME>solstice</TENAME>, celebrated on the <TENAME>feast</TENAME> day of St. <TENAME>John</TENAME> the <TENAME>Baptist</TENAME>.

In the nineteenth century <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> nationalist movements emerged promoting <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> culture and encouraging <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> to take part in cultural activities. The nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century is often regarded as a classical <TENAME>era</TENAME> of <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> culture. Posters show the influence of other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the <TENAME>Baltic-German</TENAME> artist <TENAME>Bernhard</TENAME> <TENAME>Borchert</TENAME> and the French <TENAME>Raoul</TENAME> <TENAME>Dufy</TENAME>.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed] With the onset of World War II, many <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> artists and other members of the cultural <TENAME>elite</TENAME> fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely for a <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> émigré audience.[90]
After incorporation into the Soviet Union, <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> artists and writers were forced to follow the Socialist <TENAME>realism</TENAME> style of art. During the Soviet <TENAME>era</TENAME>, music became increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the <TENAME>1980s</TENAME>. At this time, songs often made <TENAME>fun</TENAME> of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> identity. This aroused popular protests against the <TENAME>USSR</TENAME> and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry. Since independence, theatre, scenography, choir music and classical music have become the most notable branches of <TENAME>Latvian</TENAME> culture.[<TENAME>citation</TENAME> needed]
