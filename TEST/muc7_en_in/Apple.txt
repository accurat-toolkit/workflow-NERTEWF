History 
 
Main article: History of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>1976–1980: The early years 
 
 
The Apple I, Apple's first product, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. 
The owner of this unit added a keyboard and a wooden case. 
Apple was established on April 1, 1976 by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Wozniak</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Wayne</ENAMEX>,[1] to sell the Apple I personal computer kit. 
They were hand-built by Wozniak[17][18] and first shown to the public at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homebrew Computer Club</ENAMEX>.[19] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RAM</ENAMEX>, and basic textual-video chips)—less than what is today considered a complete personal computer.[20] 
The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,572 in 2011 dollars, adjusted for inflation.)[21][22][23][24][25][26] 
Apple was incorporated January 3, 1977[8] without <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne</ENAMEX>, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800. 
Multi-millionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Markkula</ENAMEX>provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.[27][28] 
The Apple II was introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first West Coast Computer Faire. 
It differed from its major rivals, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRS</ENAMEX>-80 and Commodore PET, because it came with color graphics and an open architecture. 
While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drive and interface, the Disk II.[29] 
The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer app" of the business world—the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VisiCalc</ENAMEX>spreadsheet program.[30] 
VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II, and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II—compatibility with the office.[30] 
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Bagnall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>exaggerated its sales figures and was a distant third place to Commodore and Tandy until VisiCalc came along.[31][32] 
By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. 
The company introduced the ill-fated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple III</ENAMEX>in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>in the business and corporate computing market.[33] 
Jobs and several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>employees including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jef Raskin</ENAMEX>visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX>PARC in December 1979 to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox Alto</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX>granted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>engineers three days of access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARC</ENAMEX>facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[34] 
Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (GUI), and development of a GUI began for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Lisa</ENAMEX>.[35] 
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>went public, it generated more capital than any IPO since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Company</ENAMEX>in 1956 and instantly created more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history. 
1981–1985: Lisa and Macintosh 
 
 
The Model from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s "1984" ad, set in a dystopian future modeled after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX>novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, set the tone for the introduction of the Macintosh. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>began working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Lisa</ENAMEX>in 1978 but in 1982 he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting, and took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the Macintosh. 
A turf war broke out between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa</ENAMEX>'s "corporate shirts" and Jobs' "pirates" over which product would ship first and save Apple. 
Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.[36] 
The first Macintosh, released in 1984 
In 1984, Apple next launched the Macintosh. 
Its debut was announced by the now famous $1.5 million television commercial "1984". 
It was directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley Scott</ENAMEX>, aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984,[37] and is now considered a watershed event for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s success[38] and a "masterpiece".[39][40] 
The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong[41] due to its high price and limited range of software titles. 
The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be offered at a reasonable price, and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package. 
The Mac was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI. 
It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[42] 
In 1985 a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sculley</ENAMEX>, who had been hired two years earlier.[43] 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>board of directors instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. 
Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple.</ENAMEX> 
Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a putsch and called a board meeting at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.[41] 
Jobs resigned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>and founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NeXT Inc.</ENAMEX>the same year.[44] 
1986–1993: Rise and fall 
See also: Timeline of Apple II family and Timeline of Macintosh models 
 
 
The Macintosh Portable was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s first "portable" Macintosh computer, released in 1989. 
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky Macintosh Portable in 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced the PowerBook in 1991, which established the modern form factor and ergonomic layout of the laptop computer.[45] 
The Macintosh Portable was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed 17 pounds with a 12-hour battery life. 
The same year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. 
It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001. 
The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.[43] 
For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. 
The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh. 
Following the success of the Macintosh LC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced the Centris line, a low-end Quadra offering, and the ill-fated Performa line that was sold in several confusing configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as Sears, Price Club, and Wal-Mart, the primary dealers for these models. 
The result was disastrous for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>as consumers did not understand the difference between models.[46] 
During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video consoles, and TV appliances. 
Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued Newton division based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sculley</ENAMEX>'s unrealistic market forecasts.[citation 
needed] Ultimately, all of this proved too-little-too-late for Apple as their market share and stock prices continued to slide.[citation 
needed] 
Apple saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>II series as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.[47] 
In 1990, Apple released the Macintosh LC with a single expansion slot for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple IIe</ENAMEX>Card to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.[47] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>stopped selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple IIe</ENAMEX>in 1993. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>continued to gain market share with Windows, focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>was delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.[48] 
Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response. 
Instead they sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>for using a graphical user interface similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Lisa</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer, Inc.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corporation</ENAMEX>.[49] 
The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed. 
At the same time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s reputation, and Sculley was replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Spindler</ENAMEX>.[50] 
1994–1997: Attempts at reinvention 
 
 
The Newton was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s first foray into the PDA markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. 
Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palm</ENAMEX>Pilot and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s own iPhone and iPad in the future. 
By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the A/UX. 
Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called eWorld, developed in collaboration with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America Online</ENAMEX>and designed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mac</ENAMEX>-friendly alternative to other online services such as CompuServe. 
The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. 
In addition, Apple was facing competition from OS/2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNIX</ENAMEX>vendors like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems</ENAMEX>. 
The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.[51] 
In 1994, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>allied with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>alliance. 
The goal was to create a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform), which would use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>hardware coupled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s software. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>alliance hoped that PReP's performance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. 
The same year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>computers to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s PowerPC processor.[52] 
In 1996, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Spindler</ENAMEX>was replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gil Amelio</ENAMEX>as CEO. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gil Amelio</ENAMEX>made many changes at Apple, including massive layoffs.[53] 
After multiple failed attempts to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS</ENAMEX>, first with the Taligent project, then later with Copland and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gershwin</ENAMEX>, Amelio chose to purchase NeXT and its NeXTSTEP operating system, bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>back to Apple as an advisor.[54] 
On July 9, 1997, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gil Amelio</ENAMEX>was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. 
Jobs became the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line. 
At the 1997 Macworld Expo, <PERSON>Steve Jobs</PERSON> announced that Apple would join <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</LOCATION></ORGANIZATION> to release new versions of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Office</ORGANIZATION> for the Macintosh, and that <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> made a $150 million investment in non-voting <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> stock.[55] 

On November 10, 1997, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Store</ENAMEX>, tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.[56][57] 
1998–2005: Return to profitability 
On August 15, 1998, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the Macintosh 128K: the iMac. 
The iMac design team was led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Ive</ENAMEX>, who would later design the iPod and the iPhone.[58][59] 
The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.[60] 
Through this period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>purchased several companies to create a portfolio of professional and consumer-oriented digital production software. 
In 1998, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>announced the purchase of Macromedia's Final Cut software, signaling its expansion into the digital video editing market.[61] 
The following year, Apple released two video editing products: iMovie for consumers and, for professionals, Final Cut Pro, which has gone on to be a significant video-editing program, with 800,000 registered users in early 2007.[62] 
In 2002 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[63] as well as Emagic for their music productivity application Logic, which led to the development of their consumer-level GarageBand application.[64][65] 
iPhoto's release the same year completed the iLife suite.[66] 
Apple retail stores allow potential customers to use floor models without making a purchase. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS X</ENAMEX>, based on NeXT's OPENSTEP and BSD Unix was released on March 24, 2001, after several years of development. 
Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS</ENAMEX>X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface. 
To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS X</ENAMEX>'s Classic environment.[67] 
On May 19, 2001, Apple opened the first official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Retail Stores</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.[68] 
later on July 9 they bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spruce Technologies</ENAMEX>, a DVD authoring company. 
On October 23 of the same year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>announced the iPod portable digital audio player, and started selling it on November 10. 
The product was phenomenally successful — over 100 million units were sold within six years.[69][70] 
In 2003, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s iTunes Store was introduced, offering online music downloads for $0.99 a song and integration with the iPod. 
The service quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[71] 
Since 2001 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the iMac G3. 
This began with the titanium PowerBook and was followed by the white polycarbonate iBook and the flat-panel iMac.[72][73] 
2005–2007: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>transition 
Main article: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>–Intel transition 
 
 
The MacBook Pro (15.4" widescreen) was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s first laptop with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>microprocessor. 
It was announced in January 2006 and is aimed at the professional market. 
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide Developers Conference</ENAMEX>keynote address on June 6, 2005, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>would begin producing Intel-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX>computers in 2006.[74] 
On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>computers to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Core Duo CPU</ENAMEX>. 
By August 7, 2006 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>had transitioned the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>product line to Intel chips, over one year sooner than announced.[74] 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Mac</ENAMEX>, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac Pro</ENAMEX>, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[75][76] 
On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[77] 
Apple also introduced Boot Camp to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS X</ENAMEX>.[78] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s success during this period was evident in its stock price. 
Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. 
In January 2006, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s market cap surpassed that of Dell.[79] Nine years prior, Dell's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEO Michael Dell</ENAMEX>said that if he ran Apple he would "shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."[80] 
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s market share in computers has grown, it remains far behind competitors using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Windows</ENAMEX>, with only about 8% of desktops and laptops in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>[81] 
2007–present: iPhone and iPad 
Delivering his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer, Inc.</ENAMEX>would from that point on be known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>, because computers were no longer the main focus of the company, which had shifted its emphasis to mobile electronic devices. 
The event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple TV</ENAMEX>.[82] The following day, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>shares hit $97.80, an all-time high at that point. 
In May, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s share price passed the $100 mark.[83] 
In an article posted on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s website on February 6, 2007, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>wrote that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without DRM (which would allow tracks to be played on third-party players) if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[84] 
On April 2, 2007, Apple and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EMI</ENAMEX>jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Store</ENAMEX>, effective in May.[85] 
Other record labels followed later that year. 
In July of the following year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Store</ENAMEX>to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[86] 
Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and brought in $1 million daily on average, with Jobs speculating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App Store</ENAMEX>could become a billion-dollar business for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>.[87] 
Three months later, it was announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>had become the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[88] 
On December 16, 2008, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>announced that after over 20 years of attending Macworld, 2009 would be the last year Apple would be attending the Macworld Expo, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Schiller</ENAMEX>would deliver the 2009 keynote in lieu of the expected Jobs.[89] 
Almost exactly one month later, on January 14, 2009, an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>memo from Jobs announced that he would be taking a six-month leave of absence, until the end of June 2009, to allow him to better focus on his health and to allow the company to better focus on its products without having the rampant media speculating about his health.[90] 
Despite Jobs' absence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with a revenue of $8.16 billion and a profit of $1.21 billion.[91]

After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. 
The iPad runs the same touch based operating system that the iPhone uses and many of the same iPhone apps are compatible with the iPad. 
This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch even with very little development time before the release. 
Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>and sold more than 300,000 units on that day and reaching 500,000 by the end of the first week.[92] 
In May of the same year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s market cap exceeded that of competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>for the first time since 1989.[93] 
Apple released the fourth generation iPhone, which introduced video calling, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design, which acts as the phone's antenna. 
Because of this antenna implementation, some iPhone 4 users reported a reduction in signal strength when the phone is held in specific ways. 
After a large amount of media coverage including mainstream news organizations, Apple held a press conference where they offered buyers a free rubber 'bumper' case, which had been proven to eliminate the signal reduction issue. 
Later that year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players which introduced a multi-touch iPod Nano, iPod Touch with FaceTime, and iPod Shuffle with buttons which brought back the buttons of earlier generations.[94][95][96] 
In October 2010, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>shares hit an all-time high, eclipsing $300.[97] 
Additionally, on October 20, Apple updated their MacBook Air laptop, iLife suite of applications, and unveiled <PERSON>Mac <ORGANIZATION>OS</ORGANIZATION> X <ORGANIZATION>Lion</PERSON></ORGANIZATION>, the latest installment in their Mac OS X operating system.[98] 
On January 6, 2011, the company opened their Mac App Store, a digital software distribution platform, similar to the existing iOS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App Store</ENAMEX>.[99] Apple was featured in the documentary Something Ventured which premiered in 2011. 
On January 17, 2011, an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>memo from Jobs announced that he will once again take a medical leave of absence, for an indefinite period, to allow him to focus on his health. 
Chief operating officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy D. Cook</ENAMEX>will take up Jobs' day-to-day operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, although Jobs will still remain "involved in major strategic decisions for the company."[100] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">After Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization in 2010, it also become the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world with an 84 percent increase to $19.1 billion.[101] 
In June of 2011, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>unveiled its new online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files and software -- iCloud. 
[102] 
It has been argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>has achieved such efficiency in their supply chain[103] that they have something like a monopsony (one buyer, many sellers) in that it can dictate terms to its suppliers[104]. 
As of July 2011, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>has bigger financial reserves than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>government, 76.4 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>dollars, compared with the government's 73.7 billion.[105][dated

iPad 
Main article: iPad 
On January 27, 2010, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, the iPad running a modified version of iOS. 
It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, magazines, ebooks, textbooks, photos, movies, TV shows videos, music, word processing documents, spreadsheets, video games, and most existing iPhone apps.[106] 
It also includes a mobile version of Safari for web browsing, as well as access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App Store</ENAMEX>, iTunes Library, iBooks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Store</ENAMEX>, contacts, and notepad. 
Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user's computer.[107] 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> is currently the sole <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.[108] 

On March 2, 2011, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced an updated iPad model which had a faster processor and two cameras on the front and back respectively. 
The iPad 2 also added support for optional 3G service provided by Verizon in addition to the existing offering by <ORGANIZATION>AT&T.</ORGANIZATION>[109] 
However, the availability of the iPad 2 has been limited as a result of the devastating tsunami and ensuing earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>in March 2011.[110] 
iPod 
Main article: iPod 
 
 
The current iPod family, featuring the iPod Shuffle, iPod Nano, iPod Classic, and iPod Touch 
On October 23, 2001, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>introduced the iPod digital music player. 
It has evolved to include various models targeting the wants of different users. 
The iPod is the market leader in portable music players by a significant margin, with more than 220 million units shipped as of September 2009.[111] 
Apple has partnered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>to offer the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>+iPod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports Kit</ENAMEX>enabling runners to synchronize and monitor their runs with iTunes and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>+ website. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>currently sells four variants of the iPod. 
iPod Classic (previously named iPod from 2001 to 2007), portable media player first introduced in 2001, currently available in a 160 GB model. 
iPod Nano, portable media player first introduced in 2005, currently available in 8 and 16 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX>models. 
The newest generation has a FM radio, a pedometer, and a new multi-touch interface that replaced the traditional iPod click wheel. 
iPod Shuffle, digital audio player first introduced in 2005, currently available in 2 and 4 GB models. 
iPod Touch, portable media player that runs iOS, first introduced in September 2007 after the iPhone went on sale. 
Currently available in 8, 32, and 64 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX>models. 
The latest generation features the Apple A4 processor, a Retina Display, and dual cameras on the front and back. 
The back camera allows video recording at 720p. 
iPhone 
Main article: iPhone 
At the <ORGANIZATION>Macworld Conference & Expo</ORGANIZATION> in January 2007, <PERSON>Steve Jobs</PERSON> revealed the long anticipated[112] iPhone, a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.[113] 
The original iPhone combined a 2.5G quad band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDGE</ENAMEX>cellular phone with features found in hand held devices, running scaled-down versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS X</ENAMEX>(dubbed iOS, formerly iPhone OS), with various <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS</ENAMEX>X applications such as Safari and Mail. 
It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather. 
The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touch screen display, 4, 8, or 16 GB of memory, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and "g").[113] 
The iPhone first became available on June 29, 2007 for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> contract.[114] 
On February 5, 2008, Apple updated the original iPhone to have 16 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX>of memory, in addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.[115] 
On June 9, 2008, at WWDC 2008, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>announced that the iPhone 3G would be available on July 11, 2008.[116] 
This version added support for 3G networking, assisted-GPS navigation, and a price cut to $199 for the 8 GB version, and $299 for the 16 GB version, which was available in both black and white. 
The new version was visually different from its predecessor in that it eliminated the flat silver back, and large antenna square for a curved glossy black or white back. 
Following complaints from many people, the headphone jack was changed from a recessed jack to a flush jack to be compatible with more styles of headphones. 
The software capabilities changed as well, with the release of the new iPhone came the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App Store</ENAMEX>; the store provided applications for download that were compatible with the iPhone. 
On April 24, 2009, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App Store</ENAMEX>surpassed one billion downloads.[117] 
On June 8, 2009, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s annual worldwide developers conference, the iPhone 3GS was announced, providing an incremental update to the device including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control. 
On June 7, 2010, at WWDC 2010, the iPhone 4 was announced, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>says is its "'biggest leap we've taken" since the original iPhone.[118] 
The phone includes an all-new design, 960x640 display, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s A4 processor used in the iPad, a gyroscope for enhanced gaming, 5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MP</ENAMEX>camera with LED flash, front-facing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VGA</ENAMEX>camera and FaceTime video calling. 
Shortly after the release of the iPhone 4, it was realized by consumers that the new iPhone had reception issues. 
This is due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phones cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. 
The current fix for this issue was a "Bumper Case" for the phone distributed for free to all iPhone 4 owners for a few months. 
In June 2011, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>overtook Nokia to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume.[119] 
Apple TV 
Main article: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>TV 
 
 
The Apple TV, in its most recent revision 
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple TV</ENAMEX>, (previously known as the iTV),[120] a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. 
The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams from an additional four. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple TV</ENAMEX>originally incorporated a 40 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX>hard drive for storage, includes outputs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDMI</ENAMEX>and component video, and plays video at a maximum resolution of 720p.[121] 
On May 31, 2007 a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model[122] and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple TV</ENAMEX>.[123] In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX>Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB Apple TV</ENAMEX>. 
On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of iPod devices for the year, Apple released a completely redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple TV</ENAMEX>. 
The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of flash memory to cache media downloaded. 
Apple with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>TV has added another device to its portfolio that runs on its A4 processor along with the iPad and the iPhone. 
The memory included in the device is the half of the iPhone 4 at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch 3G, and iPod touch 4G.[124] It has HDMI out as the only video out source. 
Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. 
Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. 
Software 
See also: List of Macintosh software 
<ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> develops its own operating system to run on Macs, <PERSON>Mac OS X</PERSON>, the latest version being <PERSON>Mac OS X <ORGANIZATION>Lion</PERSON></ORGANIZATION> (version 10.7). 
Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its Mac OS X operating system. 
Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. 
An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles iDVD, iMovie, iPhoto, iTunes, GarageBand, and iWeb. 
For presentation, page layout and word processing, iWork is available, which includes Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. 
iTunes, QuickTime media player, Safari web browser, and Software Update are available as free downloads for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac OS</ENAMEX>X and Windows. 
Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. 
Their range of server software includes the operating system <PERSON><ORGANIZATION>Mac</ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION>OS</PERSON> X Server; Apple Remote Desktop</ORGANIZATION>, a remote systems management application; <ORGANIZATION>WebObjects</ORGANIZATION>, Java EE Web application server; and Xsan, a Storage Area Network file system. 
For the professional creative market, there is Aperture for professional RAW-format photo processing; Final Cut Studio, a video production suite; Logic, a comprehensive music toolkit and Shake, an advanced effects composition program. 
Apple also offers online services with MobileMe (formerly . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>) that bundles personal web pages, email, Groups, iDisk, backup, iSync, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Learning Center</ENAMEX>online tutorials. 
MobileMe is a subscription-based internet suite that capitalizes on the ability to store personal data on an online server and thereby keep all web-connected devices in sync.[125] 
Announced at MacWorld Expo 2009, iWork.com 
allows iWork users to upload documents for sharing and collaboration.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate 
Apple</ENAMEX>was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). 
Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. 
Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a Fortune 500 company. 
By the time of the "1984" TV ad, this trait had become a key way the company attempts to differentiate itself from its competitors.[126] 
As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ, especially after Jobs' return. 
To recognize the best of its employees, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Fellows</ENAMEX>program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Apple Fellowship</ORGANIZATION> has so far been awarded to a few individuals including <PERSON>Bill Atkinson</PERSON>,[127] <PERSON>Steve Capps</PERSON>,[128] <PERSON>Rod Holt</PERSON>,[127] <PERSON>Alan Kay</PERSON>,[129][130] <PERSON>Guy Kawasaki</PERSON>,[129][131] <PERSON>Al Alcorn</PERSON>,[132] <PERSON>Don Norman</PERSON>,[129] <PERSON>Rich Page</PERSON>,[127] and <PERSON>Steve Wozniak</PERSON>.[127] 
Numerous employees of <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>Apple</LOCATION></ORGANIZATION> have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often take longer than projects with his involvement.[133] 
Another presents the image of Jobs "wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand, asking random people 'do you work on MobileMe?'".[134] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Users 
 
 
Apple</ENAMEX>aficionados wait in line around an Apple retail store in anticipation of a new product. 
This branch is located on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>, with a glass cube housing a cylindrical elevator and a spiral staircase that lead into the subterranean store. 
While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. 
At one time, Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. 
Apple evangelist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Kawasaki</ENAMEX>has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon".[135] 
Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac User Groups</ENAMEX>in most major and many minor centers of population where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>computers are available. 
Mac users would meet at the <ORGANIZATION>European Apple Expo</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Macworld Conference</ORGANIZATION> & Expo trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. 
While the conferences continue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>does not have official representation there. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Store</ENAMEX>openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.[136] 
The New York City Fifth <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avenue</ENAMEX>"Cube" store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.[137] 
The Ginza opening in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.[138] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sculley</ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Guardian</ENAMEX>newspaper in 1997: "People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. 
It was the marketing company of the decade."[139] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX>in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and more well-educated than other PC company consumers. 
The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>products are more expensive than other PC products.[140][141] 
Corporate affairs 
 
See also: List of mergers and acquisitions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, Braeburn Capital, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FileMaker Inc.</ENAMEX> 
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>'s early history <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[142] 
This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9500</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Macs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>has since adopted USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as USB.[143] FireWire is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as IEEE 1394.[144] 
Ever since the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Store</ENAMEX>opened, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>has sold third party accessories.[145] 
This allows, for instance, Nikon and Canon to sell their Mac-compatible digital cameras and camcorders inside the store. 
Adobe, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s oldest software partners,[146] also sells its Mac-compatible software, as does Microsoft, who sells <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Office</ENAMEX>for the Mac. 
Books from John <ORGANIZATION>Wiley & Sons</ORGANIZATION>, who publishes the For Dummies series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however. 
The publisher's line of books were banned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Stores</ENAMEX>in 2005 because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jobs</ENAMEX>biography, iCon.[147]

Company headquarters on Infinite Loop in Cupertino, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California 
Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>'s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX>, at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>. 
This Apple campus has six buildings that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) and was built in 1993 by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sobrato Development Cos.</ENAMEX>[148] 
In 2006, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>announced its intention to build a second campus on 50 acres (200,000 m2) assembled from various contiguous plots (east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N Wolfe Road</ENAMEX>between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pruneridge Avenue</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vallco Parkway</ENAMEX>). 
The new campus, also in Cupertino, will be about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the current campus.[149] 
The new campus building will be designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Foster</ENAMEX>[150]

Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial to the more modern 'Get a Mac' adverts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though its advertising has been criticized for the claims of some more recent campaigns, particularly 2005 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Mac</ENAMEX>ads[151][152][153] and iPhone ads in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. 
Logos 
See also: U+F8FF or ?, seen as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>logo in some fonts. 
The original logo with Isaac Newton under an apple tree 
 
The rainbow "bitten" logo, used from late 1976 to 1998 
 
The monochrome logo, used since 1998 
<ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION>'s first logo, <LOCATION><PERSON>Wayne</LOCATION></PERSON>, depicts Sir <PERSON>Isaac Newton</PERSON> sitting under an apple tree. 

Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Janoff</ENAMEX>'s "rainbow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple"</ENAMEX>, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. 
Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">While Jobs</ENAMEX>liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.[154][155] 
The Apple logo was designed with a bite so that it wouldn't be recognized as another fruit. 
The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the monitor could reproduce images in color.[156] 
The logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Turing</ENAMEX>, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.[157][158] 
Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.[156][159] 
In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. 
An Aqua-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001–2003, and a Glass-themed version has been used since 2003. 
In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>has had trademark issues between themselves and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Corps</ENAMEX>ltd., a multimedia company started by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beatles</ENAMEX>in 1967, involving their name and logo. 
This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. 
These issues finally ended with their most recent law suit in 2007. 
Slogans 
Main article: List of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>slogans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s first slogan, "Byte into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s.[160] 
From 1997–2002, Apple used the slogan Think Different in advertising campaigns. 
The slogan had a lasting impact on their image and revived their popularity with the media and customers, and the grammar caused a bit of discussion (i.e. "think" is a verb, which is modified by adverbs; therefore the adverb "differently" should be used, not the adjective "different"[161]). 
Although the slogan has been retired, it is still closely associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>.[162] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>also has slogans for specific product lines — for example, "iThink, therefore iMac" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[163] and "Say hello to iPhone" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[164] 
"Hello" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, <LOCATION><PERSON>Newton</LOCATION></PERSON>, iMac ("hello (again)"), and iPod.[165] 

Commercials 
See also: 1984 (advertisement), Lemmings (advertisement), iPod advertising, and music used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc. 
Apple</ENAMEX>'s product commercials gained fame for launching musicians into stardom as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[166] 
First, the company popularized Canadian singer Feist's "1234" song in its ad campaign.[166] 
Later, Apple used the song "New Soul" by French-Israeli singer-songwriter Yael Na?m to promote the MacBook Air.[166] 
The debut single shot to the top of the charts and sold hundreds of thousands of copies in a span of weeks.[166] 
Environmental record 
 
Wikinews has related news: 'Apple's data is dirtiest,' says Greenpeace 
Greenpeace, an environmental organization, has confronted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>on various environmental issues, including promoting a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable hardware components, and toxins within the iPhone hardware.[167][168] 
Since 2003 they have campaigned against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>regarding their chemical policies, in particular the inclusion of PVC and BFRs in their products, both of which have serious negative health effects.[167] 
At the 2007 Macworld Expo, Greenpeace presented a critique of Apple. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Hind</ENAMEX>, the legislative director of Greenpeace's toxics campaign, said, "(The company) is getting greener, but not green enough." 
Hind commented further, "The MacBook Air has less toxic PVC plastic and less toxic BFRs, but it could have zero and that would make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>an eco-leader."[169] 
On May 2, 2007, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>released a report announcing plans to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVC</ENAMEX>and BFRs by the end of 2008.[170][171] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>has since eliminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVC</ENAMEX>and BFRs across its product range.[172] 
It became the first laptop maker to remove PVC and BFRs.[173] 
In Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics that scores electronics manufacturers on their policies regarding toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change, Apple ranked 9th out of 18 leading electronic makers in October 2010 with a score of 4.9/10 (securing the same score as in the previous version of the guide, however slipping 4 places down the ranking).[174] 
Greenpeace criticizes for example that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>does not provide information about its management of chemicals and its supply chain communications. 
Apple also continues to score poorly in the Greenpeace's guide for the minimal information it provides about its future toxic chemical phase-out plans.[175] 
In the first edition, released in August 2006, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>scored 2.7/10.[176] 
In 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>in their top category "Striding".[177] 
This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of a 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".[16] 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>rates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>highest amongst producers of notebook computers, and fairly well compared to producers of desktop computers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCD</ENAMEX>displays.[178][179] 
In June 2007, Apple upgraded the MacBook Pro, replacing cold cathode fluorescent lamp ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCFL</ENAMEX>) backlit LCD displays with mercury-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LED</ENAMEX>backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass,[180] and has since done this for all notebooks. 
Apple has also phased out BFRs and PVCs from various internal components.[170][181][182] 
Apple also offers detailed information about the emissions, materials, and electrical usage of each product.[183] 
In June 2009, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s iPhone 3GS was free of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVC</ENAMEX>, arsenic, BFRs and had an efficient power adapter.[180] 
In October 2009, Apple upgraded the iMac and MacBook, replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCFL</ENAMEX>) backlit LCD displays with mercury-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LED</ENAMEX>backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass.[184] 
This means all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>computers have mercury free LED backlit displays, arsenic-free glass and are without PVC cables. 
All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>computers also have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPEAT</ENAMEX>Gold status.[180] 
In popular culture 
 
In 2009, British pop band The Mentalists (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Offley</ENAMEX>) achieved international press recognition for being the first band to perform a song using only iPhones and iPods.

In 2006, the Mail on Sunday reported that sweatshop conditions existed in some factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, where the contract manufacturers, Foxconn and Inventec, operate the factories that produce the iPod.[187] 
The article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the iPod (among other items), for instance, had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week. 
The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.[15][188][189][190] 
Immediately after the allegations, Apple launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturers to ensure that conditions were acceptable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>.[191] 
In 2007, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. 
Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.[192] 
In 2010, workers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. 
One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[193]
