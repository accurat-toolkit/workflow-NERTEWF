<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corporation</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>NASDAQ: MSFT</ORGANIZATION>) is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. 
Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASIC</ENAMEX>interpreters for the Altair 8800, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Windows</ENAMEX>line of operating systems. 
Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Office</ENAMEX>. 
The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. 
The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>employees. 
In May 2011, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corporation</ENAMEX>acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skype Communications</ENAMEX>for $8.5 billion dollars.[1] 
Primarily in the 1990s, critics contend <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> used monopolistic business practices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying, put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software, and used misrepresentative marketing tactics; both the <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> and European Commission found the company in violation of antitrust laws. 
Known for its interviewing process with obscure questions, various studies and ratings were generally favorable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s diversity within the company as well as its overall environmental impact with the exception of the electronics portion of the business.

History

<PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> (respectively) on October 19, 1981 in a sea of PCs after signing a pivotal contract. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>in July 1980 inquiring about programming languages for its upcoming PC line;[2] after failed negotiations with another company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>a contract to develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OS</ENAMEX>for the new line of PCs.[3] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Allen</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, childhood friends with a passion in computer programming, were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. 
The January 1975 issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems</ENAMEX>'s (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>noticed that they could program a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASIC</ENAMEX>interpreter for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. 
Since they didn't actually have one, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> worked on a simulator for the Altair while <PERSON><ORGANIZATION>Gates</PERSON></ORGANIZATION> developed the interpreter. 
Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITS</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>in March 1975; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITS</ENAMEX>agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[4] 
They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO.[5] Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," as recounted in a 1995 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX>magazine article. 
In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCII Magazine</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, resulting in its first international office, "ASCII Microsoft".[6] 
The company moved to a new home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bellevue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>in January 1979.[5] 
Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix, called Xenix.[7] 
However, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOS</ENAMEX>(Disk Operating System) that solidified the company's dominance. 
After negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>Digital Research</ORGANIZATION> failed, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> awarded a contract to <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> in November 1980 to provide a version of the <ORGANIZATION>CP/M OS</ORGANIZATION>, which was set to be used in the upcoming <ORGANIZATION>IBM Personal Computer</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> PC).[8] For this deal, <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> purchased a <ORGANIZATION>CP</ORGANIZATION>/M clone called 86-<ORGANIZATION>DOS</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>Seattle</LOCATION> Computer Products</ORGANIZATION>, branding it as MS-DOS, which <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> rebranded to PC-DOS. 
Following the release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. 
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>copyrighted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>hardware to run as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. 
Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection[citation needed], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>eventually became the leading PC OS vendor.[3][9] 
The company expanded into new markets with the release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Mouse</ENAMEX>in 1983, as well as a publishing division named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Press</ENAMEX>.[10] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Allen</ENAMEX>resigned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>in February after developing Hodgkin's disease.[11] 
1984–1994: Windows and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>While jointly developing a new OS with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>in 1984, OS/2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>released <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>Windows, a graphical extension for MS-DOS, on November 20.[12] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond on February 26, 1986, and on March 13 the company went public;[13] the ensuing rise in the stock would make an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>employees.[14] 
Due to the partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, in 1990 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX>set its eye on Microsoft for possible collusion; it marked the beginning of over a decade of legal clashes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>Government.[15] Microsoft announced the release of its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987;[16] meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit OS, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Windows NT</ENAMEX>, using ideas from OS/2; it shipped on July 21, 1993 with a new modular kernel and the Win32 application programming interface (API), making porting from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows easier. 
Once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>of NT, the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[17] 
Microsoft introduced its office suite, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Office</ENAMEX>, in 1990. 
The software bundled separate office productivity applications, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Word</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>.[18] 
On May 22 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>launched Windows 3.0 with a streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>386 processor.[19] 
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[20][21] 
Novell, a Word competitor from 1984–1986, filed a lawsuit years later claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage.[22] 
On July 27, 1994, the <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION>, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part: "Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive "per processor" licenses. 
Under a per processor license, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>pays <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. 
In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>'s use of a competing PC operating system. 
Since 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s use of per processor licenses has increased."[23] 
1995–2005: Internet and the 32-bit era <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>giving his deposition in 1998 for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>trial. 
Once the <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> 1993 took over from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a protracted legal wrangling between <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> and the department ensued, resulting in various settlements and possible blocked mergers. 
Microsoft would point to companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>in its defense.[15] 
Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>'s internal "Internet Tidal Wave memo" on May 26, 1995 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[24] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[25][26] Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, and for OEMs Internet Explorer, a web browser. 
Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[27] 
Branching out into new markets in 1996, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>Universal created a new 24/7 cable news station, MSNBC.[28] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[29] 
In October 1997, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>filed a motion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal District Court</ENAMEX>, stating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[30] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>handed over the CEO position on January 13, 2000 to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Ballmer</ENAMEX>, an old college friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gates</ENAMEX>and employee of the company since 1980, creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[5][31] 
Various companies including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>formed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trusted Computing Platform Alliance</ENAMEX>in October 1999 to, among other things, increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. 
Critics decry the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, a form of digital rights management; for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner as well.[32][33] 
On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> v. <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>,[34] calling the company an "abusive monopoly";[35] it settled with the <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> in 2004.[13] 
On October 25, 2001 Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>codebase.[36] 
The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[37] 
In March 2004 the <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>European Union</LOCATION></ORGANIZATION> brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player, Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows <ORGANIZATION>XP Professional N.</ORGANIZATION>[38][39]

CEO <PERSON>Steve Ballmer</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>MIX</ORGANIZATION> event in 2008. 
In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. 
Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[40] 
Released in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Windows Vista, focused on features, security, and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[41][42] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Office</ENAMEX>2007, released at the same time, featured a "Ribbon" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. 
Relatively strong sales of both titles helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[43] 
The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers. 
Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that "these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved".[44] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>retired from his role as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Software</ENAMEX>Architect on June 27, 2008 while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[45] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azure Services Platform</ENAMEX>, the company's entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[46] 
On February 12, 2009, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>announced its intent to open a chain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009 the first retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Store</ENAMEX>opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scottsdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>; the same day the first store opened Windows 7 was officially released to the public. 
Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease of use features and performance enhancements, rather than a large reworking of Windows.[47][48][49] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. 
Other founding companies include Google, HP Networking, Yahoo, Verizon, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Telekom</ENAMEX>and 17 other companies. 
The nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a new cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[50] 
The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers and other networking areas.[51] 
Product divisions 
 
<LOCATION>Main</LOCATION> article: <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Product</ORGANIZATION> Divisions 
For the 2010 fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> had five product divisions: Windows & <PERSON>Windows Live Division</PERSON>, Server and Tools, <ORGANIZATION>Online</ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION>Services Division</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Business Division</ORGANIZATION>, and Entertainment and <ORGANIZATION>Devices Division</ORGANIZATION>. 

Windows & <PERSON>Windows <ORGANIZATION>Live Division</PERSON></ORGANIZATION>, Server and Tools, <ORGANIZATION>Online</ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION>Services Division</ORGANIZATION> 
The company's <ORGANIZATION>Client</ORGANIZATION> division produces the flagship Windows OS line such as Windows 7; it also produces the Windows Live family of products and services. 
Server and Tools produces the server versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2008 R2 as well as a set of development tools called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Visual Studio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>Silverlight, a web application framework, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems Management Server</ENAMEX>, a collection of tools providing remote-control abilities, patch management, software distribution and a hardware/software inventory. 
Other server products include: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft SQL Server</ENAMEX>, a relational database management system, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Exchange Server</ENAMEX>, for certain business-oriented e-mail and scheduling features, Small Business Server, for messaging and other small business-oriented features; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft BizTalk Server</ENAMEX>, for business process management. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IT</ENAMEX>consulting (" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Consulting Services"</ENAMEX>) and produces a set of certification programs handled by the Server and Tools division designed to recognize individuals who have a minimal set of proficiencies in a specific role; this includes developers (" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Certified Solution Developer"</ENAMEX>), system/network analysts (" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer"</ENAMEX>), trainers (" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Certified Trainers"</ENAMEX>) and administrators (" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator"</ENAMEX>and " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Certified Database Administrator"</ENAMEX>). 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Press</ENAMEX>, which publishes books, is also managed by the division. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Online Services Business</ENAMEX>division handles the online service MSN and the search engine Bing. 
As of December 2009, the company also possesses an 18% ownership of the cable news channel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX>without any editorial control; however, the division develops the channel's website, msnbc.com, in a joint venture with the channel's co-owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Universal</ENAMEX>.[52] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Division 
 
 
Front</ENAMEX>entrance to building 17 on the main campus of the company's Redmond campus. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Business Division produces Microsoft Office including Microsoft Office</ENAMEX>2010, the company's line of office software. 
The software product includes Word (a word processor), Access (a relational database program), Excel (a spreadsheet program), Outlook (Groupware, frequently used with Exchange Server), PowerPoint (presentation software), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publisher</ENAMEX>(desktop publishing software). 
A number of other products were added later with the release of Office 2003 including Visio, Project, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MapPoint</ENAMEX>, InfoPath and OneNote. 
The division also develops enterprise resource planning ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERP</ENAMEX>) software for companies under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Dynamics</ENAMEX>brand. 
These include: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Dynamics AX, Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Microsoft Dynamics GP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Dynamics SL</ENAMEX>. They are targeted at varying company types and countries, and limited to organizations with under 7,500 employees.[53] 
Also included under the Dynamics brand is the customer relationship management software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</ENAMEX>, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azure Services Platform</ENAMEX>. 
Entertainment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division 
The Entertainment and Devices Division</ENAMEX>produces the Windows CE OS for embedded systems and Windows Phone 7 for smartphones.[54] 
Microsoft initially entered the mobile market through Windows CE for handheld devices, eventually developing into the Windows Mobile OS and now, Windows Phone 7. Windows CE is designed for devices where the OS may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, appliances and cars. 
The division also produces computer games that run on Windows PCs and other systems including titles such as Age of Empires, Halo and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>Flight Simulator series, and houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh Business Unit</ENAMEX>which produces Mac OS software including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Office</ENAMEX>2011 for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Entertainment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devices Division</ENAMEX>designs, markets, and manufactures consumer electronics including the Xbox 360 game console, the handheld Zune media player, and the television-based Internet appliance MSN TV. 
Microsoft also markets personal computer hardware including mice, keyboards, and various game controllers such as joysticks and gamepads. 
Culture 
 
Technical reference for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Systems Journal</ENAMEX>(or MSJ) are available through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Developer Network</ENAMEX>(MSDN). 
MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>software.[55][56] 
In April 2004 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>launched a community site for developers and users, titled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Channel</ENAMEX>9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[57] 
Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[58] 
Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. 
Helpful people can be elected by peers or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>employees for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Most Valuable Professional</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVP</ENAMEX>) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[59] 
Noted for its internal lexicon, the expression "eating our own dog food" is used to describe the policy of using prerelease and beta versions of products inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>in an effort to test them in "real-world" situations.[60] 
This is usually shortened to just "dog food" and is used as noun, verb, and adjective. 
Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV ("Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[61] 
The company is also known for its hiring process, mimicked in other organizations and dubbed the "Microsoft interview", which is notorious for off-the-wall questions such as "Why is a manhole cover round?".[62] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H1B visas, which allow companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>to employ certain foreign workers. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating "I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap" in 2005.[63] 
Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[64] 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index</ENAMEX>, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual) employees, rated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[65] 
Corporate affairs 
 
The company is run by a board of directors made up of mostly company outsiders, as is customary for publicly traded companies. 
Members of the board of directors as of June 2010 are: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Ballmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dina Dublon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>(chairman), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Gilmartin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reed Hastings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Klawe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Marquardt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Noski</ENAMEX>, and Helmut Panke.[66] Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system. 
There are five committees within the board which oversee more specific matters. 
These committees include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Committee</ENAMEX>, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compensation Committee</ENAMEX>, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Committee</ENAMEX>, which handles financial matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nominating Committee</ENAMEX>, which handles various corporate matters including nomination of the board; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antitrust Compliance Committee</ENAMEX>, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating antitrust laws.[67] 
Five year history graph of ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASDAQ:MSFT</ENAMEX>) stock on September 29, 2009.[68] 
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock price was $21; after the trading day, the price closed at $27.75. 
As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPO</ENAMEX>shares would be multiplied by 288; if one was to buy the IPO today given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[69][70][71] 
The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928 adjusting for splits).[72] 
The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[72][73] 
Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s stock remained steady for years.[73][74] 
One of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s business tactics, described by an executive as "embrace, extend and extinguish," initially embraces a competing standard or product, then extends it to produce their own version which is then incompatible with the standard, which in time extinguishes competition that does not or cannot use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s new version.[75] 
Various companies and governments sue Microsoft over this set of tactics, resulting in billions of dollars in rulings against the company.[76][34][39] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>claims that the original strategy is not anti-competitive, but rather an exercise of its discretion to implement features it believes customers want.[77] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial 
Standard and Poor's</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX>have both given a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX>rating to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consequently</ENAMEX>, in February 2011 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[78] 
For the first time in 20 years <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>surpassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Online</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Division</ENAMEX>(which contains its search engine Bing). 
Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Inc.</ENAMEX>profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[79] 
Microsoft's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Online</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Division</ENAMEX>has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. 
This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[80] 
Environment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>is ranked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">17th</ENAMEX>place in Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.[81] 
Microsoft’s timeline for phasing out BFRs and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVC</ENAMEX>is not clear. 
As yet (January 2011) it has no products that are completely free from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVC</ENAMEX>and BFRs.[82] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s main <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy and Environmental Design</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEED</ENAMEX>) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX>campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[83] 
Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. 
It created one of the worlds largest private bus systems, the "Connector", to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the "Shuttle Connect" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. 
The company also subsidises regional public transport as an incentive.[83][84] 
In February 2010 however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOV</ENAMEX>) lanes to a bridge connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Redmond</ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[85] 
Marketing 
In 2004, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCO</ENAMEX>) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[86] 
This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee Group</ENAMEX>concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>products.[87] 
Another study, released by the OSDL, claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCO</ENAMEX>of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[88] 
As part of the "Get the Facts" campaign Microsoft highlighted the .NET trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, claiming that it provided "five nines" reliability. 
After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[89][90] the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSE</ENAMEX>announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux based one in 2010.[91][92] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>adopted the so-called " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pac-Man Logo</ENAMEX>", designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Baker</ENAMEX>, in 1987. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>stated "The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s  to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed."[93] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Norris</ENAMEX>ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was discarded.[94] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s logo with the "Your potential. 
Our passion." 
tagline below the main corporate name, is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. 
In 2002, the company started using the logo in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and eventually started a TV campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of "Where do you want to go today?".[95][96][97] During the private MGX ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Global Exchange</ENAMEX>) conference in 2010, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>unveiled the company's next tagline, "Be What's Next.", as well as a new logo scheduled for use sometime in the future.[98]
