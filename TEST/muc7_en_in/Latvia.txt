? <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>(i/?lætvi?/; Latvian: Latvija), officially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>(Latvian: Latvijas Republika), is a country in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic</ENAMEX>region of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Europe</ENAMEX>. 
It is bordered to the north by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>(border length 343 km), to the south by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>(588 km), to the east by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Federation</ENAMEX>(276 km), and to the southeast by Belarus (141 km).[5] Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX>to the west lies <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>. 
The territory of <LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>Latvia</LOCATION></ORGANIZATION> covers 64,589 km2 (24,938 sq mi) and it has a temperate seasonal climate. 

The Latvians are Baltic people culturally related to the Estonians and Lithuanians, with the Latvian language having many similarities with Lithuanian, but not with the Estonian language (a Finnic language). 
Today the Latvian and Lithuanian languages are the only surviving members of the Baltic languages of the Indo-European family. 
The modern name of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>is thought to originate from the ancient Latvian name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Latvji</ENAMEX>, which, like the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>, may have originated from the river named Latuva.[citation needed] The country is also the home of a large number of ethnic Russians of whom many are non-citizens. 
Latvia is a unitary parliamentary republic and is divided into 118 municipalities (109 counties and 9 cities). 
The capital and largest city is Riga. 
With a population of 2.22 million, Latvia is one of the least-populous members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, and its population has declined 15.1% since 1991.[6] 
Latvia has been a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>since September 17, 1991; of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>since May 1, 2004; and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>since March 29, 2004. 
Following a period of being part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>after World War II, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>declared its independence in 1991. 
After years of economic stagnation in the early 1990s, Latvia posted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>-leading GDP growth figures during the 1998–2006 period. 
In the global financial crisis of 2008–2010 Latvia was the hardest hit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>member states, with a GDP decline of 26.54% in that period.[7][8] 
Its per capita <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDP</ENAMEX>is 49% of the EU average in 2009, making it the third poorest member-state.[9]

v · d · e 
Around the beginning of the third millennium BC (3000 BC), the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX>.[10] The Balts established trade routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX>and Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals.[11] 
By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>: Curonians, Latgalians, Selonians, Semigallians[citation needed] (in Latvian: kurši, latgaļi, sēļi and zemgaļi), as well as the Livonians (lībieši) speaking a Finnic language. 
[edit]The Medieval period 
Although the local people had had contact with the outside world for centuries, they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century.[12] 
The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daugava River</ENAMEX>in the late 12th century, seeking converts.[13] 
The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped.[13] 
German crusaders were sent into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>to convert the pagan population by force of arms.[14] 
In the beginning of the 13th century, large parts of today's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>were occupied by Germans.[13] Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia. 
In 1282, Riga, and later the cities of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cēsis</ENAMEX>, Limbaži, Koknese and Valmiera, were included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanseatic League</ENAMEX>.[13] Riga became an important point of east-west trading.[13] 
and formed close cultural contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>[citation needed]. 
[edit]The Reformation period 
The 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, including the reformation, the collapse of the Livonian state, and the time when the Latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers. 
After the Livonian War (1558–1583), Livonia (Latvia) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule.[13] 
The southern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>and the northern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>were ceded to the Grand Duchy of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>and formed into the Ducatus Ultradunensis (Pārdaugavas hercogiste). 
Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Order of Livonia, formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia[citation needed]. 
Though the duchy was a vassal state to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century. 
Latgalia, the easternmost region of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">17th</ENAMEX>and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between Polish– <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuanian Commonwealth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>for supremacy in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic.</ENAMEX> 
After the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611), northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Livonia</ENAMEX>(including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. 
Fighting continued sporadically between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>until the Truce of Altmark in 1629[citation needed]. 
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive; serfdom was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional barons was diminished.[15][16] 
Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. 
Under Swedish and largely German rule, western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lutheranism</ENAMEX>as its main religion. 
The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people, speaking one Latvian language. 
Throughout all the centuries, however, no such thing as a Latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective. 
Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, southern Latgallians adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX>under Polish/Jesuit influence. 
The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords.[17] 
[edit]Latvia in the Russian Empire 
The Capitulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Livonia</ENAMEX>in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>(it became part of the Riga Governorate)[citation needed]. 
The Latgale region remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>. 
The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia became an autonomous Russian province (the Courland Governorate) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire. 
All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, the local official language and their own parliament, the Landtag[citation needed]. 
During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic</ENAMEX>area was once again the scene of great devastation, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>the Great's scorched-earth policy, famine, and plague being responsible for catastrophic loss of human life: as much as 40% of the population in Latvian lands were killed.[18] 
In 1710, the plague reached Riga, where it was active until 1711 and claimed the lives of about half the population.[19] 
The promises Peter the Great made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltic German</ENAMEX>nobility at the fall of Riga in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nystad</ENAMEX>and known as "the Capitulations", largely reversed the Swedish reforms[citation needed]. 
The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819[citation needed]. 
In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility[citation needed], as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will". 
During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically[citation needed]. 
A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained[citation needed]. 
There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie. 
The Young Latvian (Latvian: Jaunlatvieši) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order[citation needed]. 
The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National Awakening</ENAMEX>. 
Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s[citation needed]. 
The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the New Current, a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. 
Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolution</ENAMEX>, which took a nationalist character in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic</ENAMEX>provinces.

Kārlis Ulmanis 
World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, along with other western parts of the Russian Empire. 
Demands for self-determination were at first confined to autonomy, but the Russian 1917 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolution</ENAMEX>, treaty with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>at Brest-Litovsk, and allied armistice with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>on November 11, 1918, created a power vacuum. 
The People's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Latvia</ENAMEX>proclaimed the independence of the new country in Riga on November 18, 1918, with Kārlis Ulmanis becoming the head of the provisional government[citation needed]. 
The War of Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>. 
By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments — Ulmanis' government; the Soviet Latvian government led by Pēteris Stučka, whose forces, supported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Army</ENAMEX>, occupied almost all of the country; and the Baltic German government of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Baltic Duchy</ENAMEX>, headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrievs Niedra</ENAMEX>and supported by the Baltische Landeswehr and the German Freikorps unit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Division</ENAMEX>. 
Estonian and Latvian forces[citation needed] defeated the Germans at the Battle of Wenden in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly German force — the West Russian Volunteer Army — under Pavel Bermondt-Avalov was repelled in November. 
Eastern Latvia was cleared of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Army</ENAMEX>forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the Battle of Daugavpils was a part of the Polish-Soviet War)[citation needed]. 
A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on May 1, 1920, and adopted a liberal constitution, the Satversme, in February 1922.[20] 
The constitution was partly suspended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kārlis Ulmanis</ENAMEX>after his coup in 1934, but reaffirmed in 1990. 
Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>today. 
With most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>'s industrial base evacuated to the interior of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state. 
In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.[21] 
By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level. 
Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression. 
Latvia showed signs of economic recovery and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period[citation needed]. 
On May 15, 1934, Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup, establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940.[22] 
After 1934, Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of "Latvianising" the economy.[23] 
By 1940, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>'s economy under Ulmanis ranked second in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.[24]

" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWO</ENAMEX>WORLDS": Anti-Sovietism propaganda board, Latvia, Summer, 1941. 
Early in the morning of August 24, 1939, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>and Nazi <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. 
The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s defeat in 1945, according to which the states of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>were divided into German and Soviet "spheres of influence".[25] 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>were assigned to the Soviet sphere.[25] 
Thereafter, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>and the Soviet union invaded their respective portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. 
Most of the Baltic Germans left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>by agreement between Ulmanis' government and Nazi <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>after the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.[26] 
In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939, with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>.[26] 
Most of those who remained subsequently left for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>in the Summer of 1939, when a second resettlement[citation needed] scheme was agreed.[27] 
On October 5, 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory.[28] 
On 5 October 1939 the Latvian government under pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>permitted the building of Soviet military bases, intended to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>from possible aggression by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. 
On 16 June 1940 the government of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>handed the Latvian ambassador in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>a note, in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939 and demands were made to send in additional Soviet troops and to change the government. 
The Latvian government obeyed and resigned. 
On 17 June, Soviet troops entered Latvian territory. 
In his address by radio, the dictator of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kārlis Ulmanis</ENAMEX>, announced: “Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning. 
This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government, which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. 
It is, therefore, my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units … The government has resigned. 
I shall remain in my place, you remain in yours”. 
No opposition was shown towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>forces; on the contrary, part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm, which was evidenced by the crowded pro-Soviet demonstrations. 
Observing them, the well known Russian lawyer and public figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyotr Yakobi</ENAMEX>, wrote: “Taken from the German model, the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy, having satisfied a limited circle of citizens, who have adapted themselves to the state pie. 
Clearly, any hardship is not in vain. 
And so now the down-trodden have raised their voice and demand a return of their rights that have been trampled on … “. 
Among those unhappy with the regime of Kārlis Ulmanis were not only the national minorities but also many Latvians who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and who had no desire to end up under the rule of Nazi <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. 
State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres,[29] in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed.[30] 
Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions; the resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which was granted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.[29] 
Latvia, then a puppet government, was headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusts Kirhenšteins</ENAMEX>.[31] Latvia was incorporated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>on August 5, 1940 as The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents – prior to the German invasion, in the course of less than a year, at least 27,586 persons were arrested; most were deported, and about 945 persons were shot[citation needed]. 
While under German occupation, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>was administered as part of Reichskommissariat Ostland. 
Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust as well.[22] 
More than 200,000 Latvian citizens died during World War II, including approximately 75,000 Latvian Jews murdered during the Nazi occupation.[22] 
Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict, including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS, most of them conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities[citation needed]. 
[edit]Soviet era 
Main articles: Occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>Union 1944–1945, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Stalinism 
In 1944 when the Soviet military advances reached the area heavy fighting took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">German</ENAMEX>and Soviet troops which ended with another German defeat. 
During the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's "live resources". 
In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control. 
The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. 
After the German surrender it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and Latvian national partisans, soon to be joined by German collaborators, began their fight against another occupier – the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.[32] 
Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>.[33] 
Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war,[34] returned by the West.[35] 
The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944–1945, and further mass deportations followed as the country was forcibly collectivised and Sovieticised.[22] 
On March 25, 1949, 43,000 rich residents ("kulaks") and Latvian patriots ("nationalists") were deported to Siberia in a sweeping repressive Operation Priboi in all three <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic states</ENAMEX>, which was carefully planned and approved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>already on January 29, 1949.[36] 
Between 136,000 and 190,000 Latvians, depending on the sources, were imprisoned, repressed or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the Gulag) in the post war years, from 1945 to 1952.[37] 
Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans[citation needed]. 
In the post-war period, Latvia was forced to adopt <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>farming methods and the economic infrastructure developed in the 1920s and 1930s was eradicated[citation needed]. 
Rural areas were forced into collectivisation.[38] 
An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favor of using the official language, which was Russian. 
All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belorussian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two languages of instructions in the schools- Latvian and Russian.[39] 
An influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>and other Soviet republics started. 
By 1959 about 400,000 persons arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.[40] 
Because Latvia had still maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists it was decided in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>'s most advanced manufacturing factories were to be based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
New industry was created in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, including a major machinery factory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAF</ENAMEX>in Jelgava, electrotechnical factories in Riga, chemical factories in Daugavpils, Valmiera and Olaine, as well as some food and oil processing plants.[41] 
However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories[citation needed]. 
In order to expand industrial production, skilled workers were transferred into the republic from all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.[42] 
[edit]Restoration of independence 
 
 
Barricade in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riga</ENAMEX>to prevent the Soviet Army from reaching the Latvian Parliament, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">July</ENAMEX>1991. 
In the second half of 1980s Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>started to introduce political and economic reforms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, called glasnost and Perestroika. 
In the summer of 1987 the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument- a symbol of independence. 
In the summer of 1988 a national movement, coalescing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front of Latvia</ENAMEX>, was opposed by the Interfront. 
The Latvian SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988 the old pre-war Flag of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>was allowed to be used, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990. 
In 1989, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>adopted a resolution on the "Occupation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic states</ENAMEX>", in which it declared that the occupation was "not in accordance with law," and not the "will of the Soviet people". 
Pro-independence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front of Latvia</ENAMEX>candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Council</ENAMEX>in the March 1990 democratic elections. 
On May 4, 1990, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX>of the Latvian SSR adopted the Declaration On the Restoration of Independence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, Latvian SSR was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
However, the central power in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>continued to regard <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>as Soviet republic in 1990–1991[citation needed]. 
In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>authorities by occupying the central publishing house in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riga</ENAMEX>and establishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of National Salvation</ENAMEX>to usurp governmental functions[citation needed]. 
During the transitional period <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>maintained many central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>state authorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on March 3, 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum[citation needed]. 
A large number of ethnic Russians also voted for the proposition[citation needed]. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front of Latvia</ENAMEX>had advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship. 
However, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted subsequently; not all those who had voted in support of independence received citizenship in the new Latvian state and became non-citizens. 
(The majority of non-citizens have since become naturalized citizens.) The Republic of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on August 21, 1991 in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt.[2] 
 
 
Latvia became a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. 
The Saeima, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>'s parliament, was again elected in 1993, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>completed its military withdrawal in 1994. 
The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, were achieved in 2004. 
Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many Russophones. 
(Citizenship was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation or to their subsequent offspring. 
This resulted in a situation where people who have lived and worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>for over 50 years were nonetheless unable to vote, which meant that Russian voice was largely excluded from the parliament and the government.[citation 
needed] Children born to non-nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship.) Approximately 72% of Latvian citizens are Latvian, while 20% are Russian; less than 1% of non-citizens are Latvian, while 71% are Russian.[43] 
The government denationalised private property confiscated by the Soviet rule, returning it or compensating the owners for it, and privatised most state-owned industries, reintroducing the prewar currency. 
Albeit having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal economy and its re-orientation toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, its economy had one of the highest growth rates until the 2008–2010 Latvian financial crisis.[citation

[edit]Geography 
 
Main article: Geography of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>Map of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>showing cities <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>lies mostly between latitudes 55° and 58° N (a small area is north of 58°), and longitudes 21° and 29° E (a small area is west of 21°). 
Located on the eastern shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>lies on the East European Plain. 
However, its vegetation is much different than the rest of the plain and shares many similarities with the boreal biome. 
It consists of fertile, low-lying plains, largely covered by forest, mostly pines, the highest point being the Gaiziņkalns at 311.6 m (1,022 ft). 
Phytogeographically, Latvia is shared between the Central European and Northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boreal Kingdom</ENAMEX>. 
According to the WWF, the territory of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>belongs to the ecoregion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarmatic</ENAMEX>mixed forests. 
The major rivers include the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daugava River</ENAMEX>, the Lielupe, the Gauja, the Venta, and the Salaca. 
An inlet of the <LOCATION>Baltic Sea</LOCATION>, the shallow Gulf of <LOCATION><PERSON>Riga</LOCATION></PERSON> is situated in the northwest of the country. 
Latvia's coastline extends for 531 kilometres.

See also: List of cities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, Planning regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, and Historical regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>Since 2009 Latvia has one-level municipalities – 9 republican cities (Latvian: republikas pilsētas) (Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Jūrmala, Liepāja, Rēzekne, Riga, Valmiera, Ventspils) and 110 municipalities (Latvian: novadi). 
There are four historical and cultural regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>– Courland, Latgalia, Vidzeme, Zemgale. 
Their borders usually are not explicit definite and in several sources may vary. 
To promote balanced development of all regions, in 2009 five planning regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>(Latvian: plānošanas reģioni) were created: 
 
 
Administrative divisions of Latvia 
Regions	Largest city	Area	Population 
Riga Region	Riga	10,132 km²	706,000 – (108.3/km²) 
Kurzeme Region	Liepāja	13,596 km²	301,621 – (22.1/km²) 
Latgale Region	Daugavpils	14,549 km²	343,646 – (23.5/km²)

Latvia	Riga	64,256 km²	2,248,000 – (34.9/km²) 
[edit]Climate 
The Latvian climate is humid, continental and temperate owing to the maritime influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX>. 
Summers are warm, and the weather in spring and autumn is fairly mild; however, the winters can be extreme due to the northern location. 
Precipitation is common throughout the year with the heaviest rainfall in July. 
During severe spells of winter weather, Latvia is dominated by cold winds from the interior of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, and severe snowfalls are very common. 
[edit]Biodiversity 
 
 
View from atop the tower of Gaizinkalns 
Common species of wildlife in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>include deer, wild boar, moose, lynx, bear, fox, beaver and wolves.[44] 
Non-marine molluscs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>include 159 species. 
Latvia's national trees are oak (Quercus robur), Latvian: ozols, and linden (Tilia cordata), Latvian: liepa. 
Oaks and Lindens are considered the national trees of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
The oak and the linden tree are characteristic elements of the Latvian landscape. 
Both trees are still widely used for medical purposes. 
Medicinal infusions are made of linden blossoms as well as oak bark. 
Latvian dainas (folk songs) often reflect ethical and moral concepts of earlier times. 
Amongst other trees, these folk songs most often mention the oak and linden tree. 
In traditional Latvian folk beliefs and folklore the linden tree is looked upon as a female symbol, but the oak – a male symbol. 
The nation's reverence for these trees, which in earlier times were considered sacred, can be witnessed, for example, in a landscape where, in the middle of a cultivated field there still remains a lone large, sacred oak or linden tree. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Wagtail</ENAMEX>is the national bird of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>Latvia's national bird is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Wagtail</ENAMEX>(Motacilla alba), Latvian: baltā cielava. 
This slender and graceful bird is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">April</ENAMEX>till October. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Wagtail</ENAMEX>can usually be seen running briskly along the ground, wagging its tail up and down. 
This bird typically nests in the rafters and eaves of buildings, woodpiles, stone piles, and birdhouses. 
During the winter it migrates to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Europe</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Wagtail</ENAMEX>was affirmed the national bird of Latvia in 1960 by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Bird Protection Council</ENAMEX>. 
Latvia's national flower is the oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare also known as Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), Latvian: pīpene.[45] 
In Latvian conditions, the common or wild daisy blossoms from June till September. 
Daisies are a very popular flower and are often used in flower arrangements or given as gifts. 
Latvia's national insect is the Two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata), Latvian: mārīte. 
The two-spot ladybird is familiar as a useful insect that protects plants from parasites. 
Although rather slow by nature, it can defend itself well. 
Due to its appearance and behaviour it is widely known and liked throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
The insect's Latvian name – marite – is a synonym for the ancient Latvian goddess <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mara</ENAMEX>, who embodies the power of the earth. 
The two-spot ladybird was designated the national insect of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entomological Society of Latvia</ENAMEX>.

The president is elected by the Saeima in a separate election, also held every four years. 
The president appoints a prime minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the executive branch of the government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the Saeima. 
This system also existed before World War II.[46] Highest civil servants are sixteen Secretaries of State. 
[edit]Foreign relations 
Main article: Foreign relations of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>Latvia has a representation in the European parliament since 2004. 
Membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>and NATO were major policy goals during the 1990s. 
In a nation-wide referendum on September 20, 2003, 66.9% of those taking part voted in favour of joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. 
Latvia became a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>on May 1, 2004. 
Latvia has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>member since March 29, 2004. 
The Treaty delimiting the boundary with Russia was signed and ratified in 2007. 
Under the treaty the Abrene district passed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>; talks over maritime boundary disputes with Lithuania are ongoing (the primary concern is oil exploration rights). 
[edit]Human rights 
Main article: Human rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>Human rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>are generally respected by the government.[47][48] 
Latvia is ranked above-average among the world's sovereign states in democracy,[49] press freedom,[50] privacy [51] and human development.[52] 
The country has a large ethnic Russian community, which was guaranteed basic rights under the constitution and international human rights laws ratified by the Latvian government.[47][53] 
However, human rights organisations have reported multiple problems. 
Especially non-citizens – including stateless persons – suffer from limited or no access to a broad range of rights. 
Also there were problems with police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor prison conditions and overcrowding, judicial corruption, discrimination against women, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and societal violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals.[47][54][55]

Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>is involved in the patrolling and protection of the Latvian air space as the Latvian army does not have the means to do so effectively. 
For this goal a rotating force of four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>fighters, which comes from different nations and switches at two or three month intervals, is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>to cover all three <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic states</ENAMEX>(see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltic Air Policing</ENAMEX>). 
[edit]Economy 
 
Main article: Economy of Latvia 
 
 
A high rise building 
Latvia is a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX>(1999) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>(2004). 
Since the year 2000 Latvia has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.[56] 
However, the chiefly consumption-driven growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>resulted in the collapse of the Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009, exacerbated by the global economic crisis and shortage of credit. 
Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009, the biggest fall in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>.[57][58] 
According to Eurostat data, Latvian PPS GDP per capita stood at 56 per cent of the EU average in 2008.[59] 
Real GDP growth in Latvia 1996–2006. 
This latest scenario has proven the earlier assumptions that the fast growing economy was heading for implosion of the economic bubble, because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption, financed by a serious increase of private debt, as well as a negative foreign trade balance. 
The prices of real estate, which were at some points appreciating at approximately 5% a month, were long perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low-value goods and raw materials. 
Latvia plans to introduce the Euro as the country's currency but, due to the inflation being above EMU's guidelines, the government's official target is now January 1, 2012. 
However in October 2007, with inflation above 11%, the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bank</ENAMEX>of Latvia suggested that 2013 may be a more realistic date.[60] 
Privatization in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>is almost complete. 
Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been successfully privatized, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. 
Latvian privatization efforts have led to the development of a dynamic and prosperous private sector, which accounted for nearly 68% of GDP in 2000. 
Foreign investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>is still modest compared with the levels in north-central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. 
A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. 
Representing 10.2% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>'s total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. 
In the same year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>exported $58.2 million of goods and services to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>and imported $87.9 million. 
Eager to join Western economic institutions like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX>, OECD, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, Latvia signed a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>Agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>in 1995—with a 4-year transition period. 
Latvia and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation. 
[edit] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic</ENAMEX>contraction 
Main article: 2008–2010 Latvian financial crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>is part of the Schengen Area and the EU single market. 
The Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values. 
The national account deficit for 2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10%.[5] 
Latvia's unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22%.[61] 
In April 2010 Latvia had the highest unemployment rate in the EU, at 22.5%, ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>which had 19.7%.[62] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>, the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed column for December 15, 2008: 
"The most acute problems are on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>’s periphery, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>is the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina "</ENAMEX>[63] 
However by 2010 commentators[64][65] noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy. 
Rating agency <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's</ORGANIZATION> raised its outlook on Latvia's debt from negative to stable.[64] 
Latvia's current account, which had been in deficit by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010.[64] 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Orchard</ENAMEX>, senior analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX>investors service argued that: 
"The strengthening regional economy is supporting Latvian production and exports, while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the country’s ‘internal devaluation’ is working." 
[66] 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>however warned that tax revenues were likely to be eroded due to price and wage decreases continuing until 2012,[65] adding that: 
"The sharp economic downturn is starting to bottom out, but recovery has not yet begun and sizable risks remain."[65]

Latvia's population has been multiethnic for centuries, though the demographics shifted dramatically in the twentieth century due to the World Wars, the emigration and removal of Baltic Germans, the Holocaust, and occupation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. 
According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, Germans for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%.[69] 
Latvians and Livonians, the indigenous peoples of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, now form about 59.49% of the population; 27.37% of the inhabitants are Russians, Belarusians 3.52%, Ukrainians 2.45%, Poles 2.31%, Lithuanians 1.32%, Jews 0.43%, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roma</ENAMEX>people 0.38%, Germans 0.2%, Estonians 0.1% and others 2.43%.[68] 
In some large cities, e.g. Riga, Daugavpils and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rēzekne</ENAMEX>, Russians and other minorities outnumber Latvians. 
Minorities from other countries such as Belarus, Ukraine, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>, etc., also live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
The share of ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">52</ENAMEX>% (1,387,757) in 1989.[70] 
In 2005 there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989, though their share of the population was larger — 1,357,099 (60.% of the inhabitants).[citation

[edit]Language 
Further information: Language policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>The sole official language of Latvia is Latvian, which belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic</ENAMEX>language group of the Indo-European language family. 
Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, which enjoys protection by law; Latgalian — a dialect of Latvian — is also protected by Latvian law as a historical variation of the Latvian language. 
Russian, which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, and also during the Russian Imperial period, is by far the most widely used minority language, and is understood by virtually all Latvians who started their education during the period of Soviet rule. 
While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian, most schools also include English and either German or Russian in their curricula. 
The English language is widely accepted in Latvia especially in business and tourism. 
[edit]Religion 
Main article: Religion in <LOCATION>Latvia 
 
 
Riga</LOCATION> Cathedral 
The largest religion in <LOCATION>Latvia</LOCATION> is <LOCATION><PERSON>Christianity</LOCATION></PERSON>,[5] though only about 7% of the population attends religious services regularly.[71] 
The largest groups as of 2006 were: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia</ENAMEX>– 450,000[72] 
Roman Catholic – 430,000[72] 
Orthodox – 350,000[72] 
In the Eurobarometer Poll 2005,[73] 37% of Latvian citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", while 49% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 10% stated that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force". 
Lutheranism was much stronger before the Soviet annexation, when it was a majority religion. 
Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a much greater extent than Roman Catholicism in all three <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic states</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelical Lutheran Church</ENAMEX>, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. 
An internal document of March 18, 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, but the faith has since experienced a revival.[74] 
The country's Orthodox Christians belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latvian Orthodox Church</ENAMEX>, a semi-autonomous body within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Orthodox Church</ENAMEX>. 
In 2011, there were 9,571 Jews and 182 Muslims living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>. 
There are more than 600 Latvian neopagans, Dievturi (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on Latvian mythology.[75] 
About 40% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.[citation

Riga Technical University</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>of Latvia are two major universities in the country, both been established on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riga Polytechnical Institute</ENAMEX>and located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riga</ENAMEX>.[76] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riga Stradiņš University</ENAMEX>was established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX>of Latvia, but nowadays covers a variety of various fields. 
Daugavpils <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>is another important center of education. 
Latvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010, which is a 12.9% decline, and in the same period enrollment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people, a 10.3% decline.[77] 
Another well known university in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>is LLU(Latvias lauksaimniecibas universitate)(Latvian university of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>). 
It is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jelgava</ENAMEX>.[78] 
[edit]Health 
The Latvian healthcare system is a universal program, largely funded through government taxation.[79] 
It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors.[80] 
There were 59 hospitals in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006.[81][82][83] 
The average life expectancy at birth is 72.7 years, second lowest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>.[84] 
Corruption is relatively widespread in the Latvian healthcare system, though the situation has improved since the early 1990s. 
It has been noted that an environment conducive to corruption has been promulgated by low salaries and poorly implemented systemic reforms.[85] 
This also results in brain drain, mostly to Western EU nations. 
As of 2007, there were approximately 10,000 inhabitants of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>living with HIV/AIDS.[5] 
There were 32,376 (1.44%) individual instances of clinically reported alcoholism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>in 2008, as well as cases of addictions to other substances.[86] 
The annual number of births per 1,000 adolescent women aged 15 to 19 has declined from 49,9 in 1990 to 17,9 in 2007.[87] 
In 2005, Latvia had a suicide rate of 24.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (down from 40.7 in 1995), the 7th highest in the world.[88] 
[edit] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culture</ENAMEX>Main article: Culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>Latvian country scenery in Sabile 
Traditional Latvian folklore, especially the dance of the folk songs date back well over a thousand years. 
More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified.[89] 
Between the thirteenth and nineteenth century, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltic</ENAMEX>Germans, many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into German culture, formed the upper class.[citation 
needed] They developed distinct cultural heritage, characterised by both Latvian and German influences. 
It has survived in German Baltic families to this day, in spite of their dispersal to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, the USA, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>and other countries in the early 20th century. 
However, most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life.[citation
